    "content": "## Python tools: uv\n\n[Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).\n\n[`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is a fast Python package and project manager that's becoming the standard for running Python scripts. It replaces tools like pip, conda, pipx, poetry, pyenv, twine, and virtualenv into one, enabling:\n\n- **Python Version Management**: uv installs and manages _multiple_ Python versions, allowing developers to specify and switch between versions seamlessly.\n- **Virtual Environment Handling**: It automates the creation and management of virtual environments, ensuring isolated and consistent development spaces for different projects.\n- **Dependency Management**: With support for the pyproject.toml format, uv enables precise specification of project dependencies. It maintains a universal lockfile, uv.lock, to ensure reproducible installations across different systems.\n- **Project Execution**: The `uv run` command allows for the execution of scripts and applications within the managed environment, streamlining development workflows.\n\nHere are some commonly used commands:\n\n```bash\n# Replace python with uv. This automatically installs Python and dependencies.\nuv run script.py\n\n# Run a Python script directly from the Internet\nuv run https://example.com/script.py\n\n# Run a Python script without installing\nuvx ruff\n\n# Use a specific Python version\nuv run --python 3.11 script.py\n\n# Add dependencies to your script\nuv add httpx --script script.py\n\n# Create a virtual environment at .venv\nuv venv\n\n# Install packages to your virtual environment\nuv pip install httpx\n```\n\nHere are some useful tools you can run with `uvx` without installation:\n\n```bash\nuvx --from jupyterlab jupyter-lab   # Jupyter notebook\nuvx marimo      # Interactive notebook\nuvx llm         # Chat with LLMs from the command line\nuvx openwebui   # Chat with LLMs via the browser\nuvx httpie      # Make HTTP requests\nuvx datasette   # Browse SQLite databases\nuvx markitdown  # Convert PDF to Markdown\nuvx yt-dlp      # Download YouTube videos\nuvx asciinema   # Record your terminal and play it\n```\n\nuv uses [inline script metadata](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/inline-script-metadata/#inline-script-metadata) for dependencies.\nThe eliminates the need for `requirements.txt` or virtual environments. For example:\n\n```python\n# /// script\n# requires-python = \">=3.11\"\n# dependencies = [\n#   \"httpx\",\n#   \"pandas\",\n# ]\n# ///\n```\n\n[![uv - Python package and project management | Inline Script Metadata (28 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/igWlYl3asKw/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/igWlYl3asKw?t=1240)\n\n<!-- Assessment: Share output of `uv run --with httpie -- https https://httpbin.org/get?email={email}` -->\n<!-- Assessment: Share output of `uvx markitdown {email}.pdf` -->\n<!-- Assessment: Share output of `uv ruff format script.py` -->\n"

    "content": "# Base 64 Encoding\n\nBase64 is a method to convert binary data into ASCII text. It's essential when you need to transmit binary data through text-only channels or embed binary content in text formats.\n\nWatch this quick explanation of how Base64 works (3 min):\n\n[![What is Base64? (3 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/8qkxeZmKmOY/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/8qkxeZmKmOY)\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n- It takes 3 bytes (24 bits) and converts them into 4 ASCII characters\n- ... using 64 characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, + and / (padding with `=` to make the length a multiple of 4)\n- There's a URL-safe variant of Base64 that replaces + and / with - and \\_ to avoid issues in URLs\n- Base64 adds ~33% overhead (since every 3 bytes becomes 4 characters)\n\nCommon Python operations with Base64:\n\n```python\nimport base64\n\n# Basic encoding/decoding\ntext = \"Hello, World!\"\n# Convert text to base64\nencoded = base64.b64encode(text.encode()).decode()  # SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==\n# Convert base64 back to text\ndecoded = base64.b64decode(encoded).decode()        # Hello, World!\n# Convert to URL-safe base64\nurl_safe = base64.urlsafe_b64encode(text.encode()).decode()  # SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==\n\n# Working with binary files (e.g., images)\nwith open('image.png', 'rb') as f:\n    binary_data = f.read()\n    image_b64 = base64.b64encode(binary_data).decode()\n\n# Data URI example (embed images in HTML/CSS)\ndata_uri = f\"data:image/png;base64,{image_b64}\"\n```\n\nData URIs allow embedding binary data directly in HTML/CSS. This reduces the number of HTTP requests and also works offline. But it increases the file size.\n\nFor example, here's an SVG image embedded as a data URI:\n\n```html\n<img\n  src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAzMiAzMiI+PGNpcmNsZSBjeD0iMTYiIGN5PSIxNiIgcj0iMTUiIGZpbGw9IiMyNTYzZWIiLz48cGF0aCBmaWxsPSIjZmZmIiBkPSJtMTYgNyAyIDcgNyAyLTcgMi0yIDctMi03LTctMiA3LTJaIi8+PC9zdmc+\"\n/>\n```\n\nBase64 is used in many places:\n\n- JSON: Encoding binary data in JSON payloads\n- Email: MIME attachments encoding\n- Auth: HTTP Basic Authentication headers\n- JWT: Encoding tokens in web authentication\n- SSL/TLS: PEM certificate format\n- SAML: Encoding assertions in SSO\n- Git: Encoding binary files in patches\n\nTools for working with Base64:\n\n- [Base64 Decoder/Encoder](https://www.base64decode.org/) for online encoding/decoding\n- [data: URI Generator](https://dopiaza.org/tools/datauri/index.php) converts files to Data URIs\n"

APIs are better for scale and quality.\n\n| Feature     | Local Models               | API                       |\n| ----------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------- |\n| **Privacy** | High                       | Dependent on provider     |\n| **Cost**    | High setup, low after that | Pay-as-you-go             |\n| **Scale**   | Limited by local resources | Easily scales with demand |\n| **Quality** | Varies by model            | Typically high            |\n\nThe [Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard) provides comprehensive comparisons of embedding models. These models are compared on several parameters, but here are some key ones to look at:\n\n1. **Rank**. Higher ranked models have higher quality.\n2. **Memory Usage**. Lower is better (for similar ranks). It costs less and is faster to run.\n3. **Embedding Dimensions**. Lower is better. This is the number of numbers in the array. Smaller dimensions are cheaper to store.\n4. **Max Tokens**. Higher is better. This is the number of input tokens (words) the model can take in a _single_ input.\n5. Look for higher scores in the columns for Classification, Clustering, Summarization, etc. based on your needs.\n\n### Local Embeddings\n\n[![Guide to Local Embeddings with Sentence Transformers](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OATCgQtNX2o/sddefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/OATCgQtNX2o)\n\nHere's a minimal example using a local embedding model:\n\n```python\n# /// script\n# requires-python = \"==3.12\"\n# dependencies = [\n#   \"sentence-transformers\",\n#   \"httpx\",\n#   \"numpy\",\n# ]\n# ///\n\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\nimport numpy as np\n\nmodel = SentenceTransformer('BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5')  # A small, high quality model\n\nasync def embed(text: str) -> list[float]:\n    \"\"\"Get embedding vector for text using local model.\"\"\"\n    return model.encode(text).tolist()\n\nasync def get_similarity(text1: str, text2: str) -> float:\n    \"\"\"Calculate cosine similarity between two texts.\"\"\"\n    emb1 = np.array(await embed(text1))\n    emb2 = np.array(await embed(text2))\n    return float(np.dot(emb1, emb2) / (np.linalg.norm(emb1) * np.linalg.norm(emb2)))\n\nasync def main():\n    print(await get_similarity(\"Apple\", \"Orange\"))\n    print(await get_similarity(\"Apple\", \"Lightning\"))\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    import asyncio\n    asyncio.run(main())\n```\n\nNote the `get_similarity` function. It uses a [Cosine Similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) to calculate the similarity between two embeddings.\n\n### OpenAI Embeddings\n\nFor comparison, here's how to use OpenAI's API with direct HTTP calls. Replace the `embed` function in the earlier script:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport httpx\n\nasync def embed(text: str) -> list[float]:\n    \"\"\"Get embedding vector for text using OpenAI's API.\"\"\"\n    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:\n        response = await client.post(\n            \"https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings\",\n            headers={\"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY']}\"},\n            json={\"model\": \"text-embedding-3-small\", \"input\": text}\n        )\n        return response.json()[\"data\"][0][\"embedding\"]\n```\n\n**NOTE**: You need to set the [`OPENAI_API_KEY`](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) environment variable for this to work.\n"

(This is important. If your code runs fast and fits in memory, you **DON'T** need a vector database. You can can use `numpy` for these tasks.)\n\nVector databases are an evolving space.\n\nThe first generation of vector databases were written in C and typically used an algorithm called [HNSW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_navigable_small_world) (a way to approximately find the nearest neighbor). Some popular ones are:\n\n- **[chroma 19,637 ⭐ May 2025](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma)**\n- **[qdrant 23,341 ⭐ May 2025](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant)**\n- **[lancedb 6,327 ⭐ May 2025](https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb)**\n- **[faiss 34,684 ⭐ May 2025](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss)**\n- **[milvus 34,476 ⭐ May 2025](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus)**\n- **[weaviate 13,222 ⭐ May 2025](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate)**\n\nIn addition, most relational databases now support vector search. For example:\n\n- **[DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/)**: Supports vector search with [`vss`](https://duckdb.org/docs/extensions/vss.html).\n- **[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/)**: Supports vector search with [`sqlite-vec`](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vec).\n- **[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)**: Supports vector search with [`pgvector`](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector).\n\nTake a look at this [Vector DB Comparison](https://superlinked.com/vector-db-comparison).\n\nWatch this Vector Database Tutorial (3 min):\n\n[![Vector databases are so hot right now.

    "content": "## Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with the CLI\n\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) combines retrieval (searching a knowledge base) with generation (using an LLM) to produce answers grounded in your own documents. Instead of relying solely on a general-purpose LLM, RAG lets you feed it the most relevant chunks from your corpus at query time, improving accuracy, reducing hallucinations, and allowing you to answer domain‑specific questions without fine‑tuning.\n\nIn particular, you can answer questions that are hard to answer with a keyword search. For example:\n\n```bash\nQ=\"What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?\"\n# Answer: fat arrow\n\nQ=\"What lets you walk every child node of a ts.Node?\"\n# Answer: node.getChildren()\n\nQ=\"What are code pieces like comments and whitespace that aren’t in the AST called?\"\n# Answer: trivia\n\nQ=\"Which operator converts any value into an explicit boolean?\"\n# Answer: !!\n```\n\nYou can implement RAG entirely from your terminal, without writing a single line of application code. Below is a step‑by‑step example using the TypeScript book as a data source.\n\n### 1. Clone the repository\n\n```bash\ngit clone --depth 1 https://github.com/basarat/typescript-book\ncd typescript-book\n```\n\n- `--depth 1` fetches only the latest commit to minimize download size.\n- `cd typescript-book` moves into the project folder.\n\nYou'll now be in a new folder `typescript-book` containing the repo.\n\n### 2. Split Markdown files into chunks\n\n```bash\n(\n  shopt -s globstar\n  for f in **/*.md; do\n    uvx --from split_markdown4gpt mdsplit4gpt \"$f\" --model gpt-4o --limit 4096 --separator \"===SPLIT===\" \\\n    | sed '1s/^/===SPLIT===\\n/' \\\n    | jq -R -s -c --arg file \"$f\" '\n      split(\"===SPLIT===\")[1:]\n      | to_entries\n      | map({\n          id: ($file + \"#\" + (.key | tostring)),\n          content: .value\n        })[]\n    '\n  done\n) | tee chunks.json\n```\n\n- `shopt -s globstar`: lets `**/*.md` match Markdown files in all subdirectories. [bash shopt manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/The-Shopt-Builtin.html)\n- `uvx --from split_markdown4gpt mdsplit4gpt`: [a tool](https://github.com/twardoch/split-markdown4gpt) that splits Markdown into LLM‑sized chunks:\n  - `--model gpt-4o`: uses GPT‑4o token limits\n  - `--limit 4096`: max tokens per chunk\n  - `--separator \"===SPLIT===\"`: custom split marker\n- `sed '1s/^/===SPLIT===\\n/'`: ensures the very first chunk starts with the separator (GNU sed manual)\n- `jq -R -s -c --arg file \"$f\"`: uses [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/) to convert chunks to JSON\n  - `-R`: read raw input\n  - `-s`: slurp entire input into a single string\n  - `-c`: compact JSON output\n  - builds an array of objects `{id, content}`, where `id` is `filename#chunkIndex`\n- `tee chunks.json`: writes the resulting JSON array to `chunks.json` while printing it to stdout.\n\nYou'll now have a `chunks.json` that has one `{id, content}` JSON object per line.\n\n### 3. Generate embeddings\n\n```bash\nllm embed-multi typescript-book --model 3-small --store --format nl chunks.json\n```\n\n- `embed-multi`: computes embeddings for each entry in `chunks.json`.\n- `typescript-book`: a namespace or collection name for storage.\n- `--model 3-small`: selects the embedding model.\n- `--store`: save embeddings in the default backend.\n- `--format nl`: input is newline‑delimited JSON. [llm CLI embed-multi](https://github.com/kerenter/llm#embed-multi)\n\nThis stores the embeddings in a collection called `typescript-book`.\n\n```bash\nllm collections path  # shows where the collections are stored\nllm collections delete typescript-book  # deletes the typescript-book collection\n```\n\n### 4. Find similar topics\n\n```bash\nllm similar typescript-book -n 3 -c \"What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?\"\n```\n\nThis returns the 3 chunksmost similar to the question posed.\n\n- `similar`: retrieves the top `n` most similar chunks from the embeddings store.\n- `-n 3`: return three results.\n- `-c`: the user’s query string.\n\n### 5. Answer a question using retrieved context\n\n```bash\nQ=\"What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?\"\nllm similar typescript-book -n 3 -c \"$Q\" \\\n  | jq '.content' \\\n  | llm -s \"$Q - Answer ONLY from these notes. Cite verbatim from notes.\" \\\n  | uvx streamdown\n```\n\nThis answers the question in natural language following these steps:\n\n1. Store the query in `Q`.\n2. Retrieve the top 3 matching chunks.\n3. `jq '.content'` extracts just the text snippets.\n4. Pipe into `llm -s`, instructing the model:\n   - `-s`: stream a prompt directly to the LLM.\n   - `\"$Q - Answer ONLY from these notes. Cite verbatim from notes.\"`: ensures the response is grounded.\n5. `uvx streamdown` formats the streamed LLM output for easy reading.\n\n<!--\n\nMore questions that cannot be answered via keyword search:\n\nQ=\"Which shorthand lets you both declare and initialize a class member in one go?\"\n# Answer: constructor(public x:number)\n\nQ=\"What syntax allows initializing class fields outside the constructor?\"\n# Answer: property initializer\n\nQ=\"What property name do discriminated unions use to narrow types?\"\n# Answer: kind\n\nQ=\"Which keyword pauses and resumes execution in generator functions?\"\n# Answer: yield\n\nQ=\"What JSON-style syntax defines overloads in a callable type annotation?\"\n# Answer: { (foo: string): string; }\n\nQ=\"What filename do you use to declare globals available across your entire TS project?\"\n# Answer: global.d.ts\n\nQ=\"What TS helper wraps subclass constructors for ES5-style inheritance?\"\n# Answer: __extends\n\nQ=\"What option in tsconfig.json turns on ES7 decorator support?\"\n# Answer: experimentalDecorators\n\nQ=\"What directive in tsconfig.json preserves raw JSX output?\"\n# Answer: jsx: \"preserve\"\n\nQ=\"In async/await, what wraps generator code to return a Promise?\"\n# Answer: __awaiter\n\nQ=\"What config field controls which .ts/.js files to include in compilation?\"\n# Answer: include / exclude\n\nQ=\"What npm package is recommended for structural deep-equality checks?\"\n# Answer: deep-equal\n-->\n"

Always set `strict: True` to ensure valid function calls\n   - Define all required parameters\n   - Set `additionalProperties: False`\n2. **Use tool choice**\n   - Set `tool_choice: \"required\"` to ensure that the model will always call one or more tools\n   - The default is `tool_choice: \"auto\"` which means the model will choose a tool only if appropriate\n3. **Clear Descriptions**\n   - Write detailed function and parameter descriptions\n   - Include expected formats and units\n   - Mention any constraints or limitations\n4. **Error Handling**\n   - Validate function inputs before execution\n   - Return clear error messages\n   - Handle missing or invalid parameters\n"

    "content": "## LLM Agents: Building AI Systems That Can Think and Act\n\nLLM Agents are AI systems that can define and execute their own workflows to accomplish tasks. Unlike simple prompt-response patterns, agents make multiple LLM calls, use tools, and adapt their approach based on intermediate results. They represent a significant step toward more autonomous AI systems.\n\n[![Building LLM Agents with LangChain (13 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/DWUdGhRrv2c/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/DWUdGhRrv2c)\n\n### What Makes an Agent?\n\nAn LLM agent consists of three core components:\n\n1. **LLM Brain**: Makes decisions about what to do next\n2. **Tools**: External capabilities the agent can use (e.g., web search, code execution)\n3. **Memory**: Retains context across multiple steps\n\nAgents operate through a loop:\n\n- Observe the environment\n- Think about what to do\n- Take action using tools\n- Observe results\n- Repeat until task completion\n\n### Command-Line Agent Example\n\nWe've created a minimal command-line agent called [`llm-cmd-agent.py`](llm-cmd-agent.py \":ignore\") that:\n\n1. Takes a task description from the command line\n2. Generates code to accomplish the task\n3. Automatically extracts and executes the code\n4. Passes the results back to the LLM\n5. Provides a final answer or tries again if the execution fails\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n```bash\nuv run llm-cmd-agent.py \"list all Python files under the current directory, recursively, by size\"\nuv run llm-cmd-agent.py \"convert the largest Markdown file to HTML\"\n```\n\nThe agent will:\n\n1. Generate a shell script to list files with their sizes\n2. Execute the script in a subprocess\n3. Capture the output (stdout and stderr)\n4. Pass the output back to the LLM for interpretation\n5. Present a final answer to the user\n\nUnder the hood, the agent follows this workflow:\n\n1. Initial prompt to generate a shell script\n2. Code extraction from the LLM response\n3. Code execution in a subprocess\n4. Result interpretation by the LLM\n5. Error handling and retry logic if needed\n\nThis demonstrates the core agent loop of:\n\n- Planning (generating code)\n- Execution (running the code)\n- Reflection (interpreting results)\n- Adaptation (fixing errors if needed)\n\n### Agent Architectures\n\nDifferent agent architectures exist for different use cases:\n\n1. **ReAct** (Reasoning + Acting): Interleaves reasoning steps with actions\n2. **Reflexion**: Adds self-reflection to improve reasoning\n3. **MRKL** (Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language): Combines neural and symbolic modules\n4. **Plan-and-Execute**: Creates a plan first, then executes steps\n\n### Real-World Applications\n\nLLM agents can be applied to various domains:\n\n1. **Research assistants** that search, summarize, and synthesize information\n2. **Coding assistants** that write, debug, and explain code\n3. **Data analysis agents** that clean, visualize, and interpret data\n4. **Customer service agents** that handle queries and perform actions\n5. **Personal assistants** that manage schedules, emails, and tasks\n\n### Project Ideas\n\nHere are some practical agent projects you could build:\n\n1. **Study buddy agent**: Helps create flashcards, generates practice questions, and explains concepts\n2. **Job application assistant**: Searches job listings, tailors resumes, and prepares interview responses\n3. **Personal finance agent**: Categorizes expenses, suggests budgets, and identifies savings opportunities\n4. **Health and fitness coach**: Creates workout plans, tracks nutrition, and provides motivation\n5. **Course project helper**: Breaks down assignments, suggests resources, and reviews work\n\n### Best Practices\n\n1. **Clear instructions**: Define the agent's capabilities and limitations\n2. **Effective tool design**: Create tools that are specific and reliable\n3. **Robust error handling**: Agents should recover gracefully from failures\n4. **Memory management**: Balance context retention with token efficiency\n5. **User feedback**: Allow users to correct or guide the agent\n\n### Limitations and Challenges\n\nCurrent LLM agents face several challenges:\n\n1. **Hallucination**: Agents may generate false information or tool calls\n2. **Planning limitations**: Complex tasks require better planning capabilities\n3. **Tool integration complexity**: Each new tool adds implementation overhead\n4. **Context window constraints**: Limited memory for long-running tasks\n5. **Security concerns**: Tool access requires careful permission management\n"

    "content": "## Hybrid Retrieval Augmented Generation (Hybrid RAG) with TypeSense\n\nHybrid RAG combines semantic (vector) search with traditional keyword search to improve retrieval accuracy and relevance. By mixing exact text matches with embedding-based similarity, you get the best of both worlds: precision when keywords are present, and semantic recall when phrasing varies. [TypeSense](https://typesense.org/) makes this easy with built-in hybrid search and automatic embedding generation.\n\nBelow is a fully self-contained Hybrid RAG tutorial using TypeSense, Python, and the command line.\n\n### Install and run TypeSense\n\n[Install TypeSense](https://typesense.org/docs/guide/install-typesense.html).\n\n```bash\nmkdir typesense-data\n\ndocker run -p 8108:8108 \\\n  -v typesense-data:/data typesense/typesense:28.0 \\\n  --data-dir /data \\\n  --api-key=secret-key \\\n  --enable-cors\n```\n\n- **`docker run`**: spins up a containerized TypeSense server on port 8108\n  - `-p 8108:8108` maps host port to container port.\n  - `-v typesense-data:/data` mounts a Docker volume for persistence.\n  - `--data-dir /data` points TypeSense at that volume.\n  - `--api-key=secret-key` secures your API.\n  - `--enable-cors` allows browser-based requests.\n\n**Expected output:**\n\n- Docker logs showing TypeSense startup messages, such as `Started Typesense API server`.\n- Listening on `http://0.0.0.0:8108`.\n\n### Embed and import documents into TypeSense\n\nFollow the steps in the [RAG with the CLI](rag-cli.md) tutorial to create a `chunks.json` that has one `{id, content}` JSON object per line.\n\n[TypeSense supports automatic embedding of documents](https://typesense.org/docs/28.0/api/vector-search.html#option-b-auto-embedding-generation-within-typesense). We'll use that capability.\n\nSave the following as `addnotes.py` and run it with `uv run addnotes.py`.\n\n```python\n# /// script\n# requires-python = \">=3.13\"\n# dependencies = [\"httpx\"]\n# ///\nimport json\nimport httpx\nimport os\n\nheaders = {\"X-TYPESENSE-API-KEY\": \"secret-key\"}\n\nschema = {\n    \"name\": \"notes\",\n    \"fields\": [\n        {\"name\": \"id\", \"type\": \"string\", \"facet\": False},\n        {\"name\": \"content\", \"type\": \"string\", \"facet\": False},\n        {\n            \"name\": \"embedding\",\n            \"type\": \"float[]\",\n            \"embed\": {\n                \"from\": [\"content\"],\n                \"model_config\": {\n                    \"model_name\": \"openai/text-embedding-3-small\",\n                    \"api_key\": os.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"),\n                },\n            },\n        },\n    ],\n}\n\nwith open(\"chunks.json\", \"r\") as f:\n    chunks = [json.loads(line) for line in f.readlines()]\n\nwith httpx.Client() as client:\n    # Create the collection\n    if client.get(f\"http://localhost:8108/collections/notes\", headers=headers).status_code == 404:\n        r = client.post(\"http://localhost:8108/collections\", json=schema, headers=headers)\n\n    # Embed the chunks\n    result = client.post(\n        \"http://localhost:8108/collections/notes/documents/import?action=emplace\",\n        headers={**headers, \"Content-Type\": \"text/plain\"},\n        data=\"\\n\".join(json.dumps(chunk) for chunk in chunks),\n    )\n    print(result.text)\n```\n\n- **`httpx.Client`**: an HTTP client for Python.\n- **Collection schema**: `id` and `content` fields plus an `embedding` field with auto-generated embeddings from OpenAI.\n- **Auto-embedding**: the `embed` block instructs TypeSense to call the specified model for each document.\n- **`GET /collections/notes`**: checks existence.\n- **`POST /collections`**: creates the collection.\n- **`POST /collections/notes/documents/import?action=emplace`**: bulk upsert documents, embedding them on the fly.\n\n**Expected output:**\n\n- A JSON summary string like `{\"success\": X, \"failed\": 0}` indicating how many docs were imported.\n- (On timeouts, re-run until all chunks are processed.)\n\n### 4. Run a hybrid search and answer a question\n\nNow, we can use a single `curl` against the Multi-Search endpoint to combine keyword and vector search as a [hybrid search](https://typesense.org/docs/28.0/api/vector-search.html#hybrid-search):\n\n```bash\nQ=\"What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?\"\n\npayload=$(jq -n --arg coll \"notes\" --arg q \"$Q\" \\\n  '{\n     searches: [\n       {\n         collection: $coll,\n         q:           $q,\n         query_by:    \"content,embedding\",\n         sort_by:     \"_text_match:desc\",\n         prefix:      false,\n         exclude_fields: \"embedding\"\n       }\n     ]\n   }'\n)\ncurl -s 'http://localhost:8108/multi_search' \\\n  -H \"X-TYPESENSE-API-KEY: secret-key\" \\\n  -d \"$payload\" \\\n  | jq -r '.results[].hits[].document.content' \\\n  | llm -s \"${Q} - \\$Answer ONLY from these notes. Cite verbatim from the notes.\" \\\n  | uvx streamdown\n```\n\n- **`query_by: \"content,embedding\"`**: tells TypeSense to score by both keyword and vector similarity.\n- **`sort_by: \"_text_match:desc\"`**: boosts exact text hits.\n- **`exclude_fields: \"embedding\"`**: keeps responses lightweight.\n- **`curl -d`**: posts the search request.\n- **`jq -r`**: extracts each hit’s `content`. See [jq manual](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/)\n- **`llm -s`** and **`uvx streamdown`**: generate and stream a grounded answer.\n\n**Expected output:**\n\n- The raw matched snippets printed first.\n- Then a concise, streamed LLM answer citing the note verbatim.\n"

The first is you can **download** the data. Either somebody gives you the data and says download it from here, or you are asked to download it from the internet because it's a public data source. But that's the first way—you download the data.\n2. The second way is you can **query it** from somewhere. It may be on a database. It may be available through an API. It may be available through a library. But these are ways in which you can selectively query parts of the data and stitch it together.\n3. The third way is you have to **scrape it**. It's not directly available in a convenient form that you can query or download. But it is, in fact, on a web page. It's available on a PDF file. It's available in a Word document. It's available on an Excel file. It's kind of structured, but you will have to figure out that structure and extract it from there.\n\nIn this module, we will be looking at the tools that will help you either download from a data source or query from an API or from a database or from a library. And finally, how you can scrape from different sources.\n\n[![Data Sourcing - Introduction](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1LyblMkJzOo/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/1LyblMkJzOo)\n\nHere are links used in the video:\n\n- [The Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset)\n- [IMDb Datasets](https://imdb.com/interfaces/)\n- [Download the IMDb Datasets](https://datasets.imdbws.com/)\n- [Explore the Internet Movie Database](https://gramener.com/imdb/)\n- [What does the world search for?](https://gramener.com/search/)\n- [HowStat - Cricket statistics](https://howstat.com/cricket/home.asp)\n- [Cricket Strike Rates](https://gramener.com/cricket/)\n"

You have just enrolled in the [Tools in Data Science](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/2025-01/) course.\n\nOut of kindness for your teaching assistants, you have decided to build an API that can automatically answer student questions on their behalf based on:\n\n- [Course content](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/2025-01/) with content for TDS Jan 2025 as on 15 Apr 2025.\n- [TDS Discourse posts](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/c/courses/tds-kb/34) with content from 1 Jan 2025 - 14 Apr 2025.\n\n## Scrape the data\n\nTo make sure you can answer these questions, you will need to extract the data from the above source.\n\n## Create an API\n\nYour application exposes an API endpoint. You may host it anywhere. Let's assume it's at `https://app.example.com/api/`.\n\nThe endpoint must accept a POST request, e.g. `POST https://app.example.com/api/` with a student question as well as optional base64 file attachments as JSON.\n\nFor example, here's how anyone can make a request:\n\n```bash\ncurl \"https://app.example.com/api/\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d \"{\\\"question\\\": \\\"Should I use gpt-4o-mini which AI proxy supports, or gpt3.5 turbo?\\\", \\\"image\\\": \\\"$(base64 -w0 project-tds-virtual-ta-q1.webp)\\\"}\"\n```\n\nThis is a [real question](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga5-question-8-clarification/155939) and uses this [screenshot](images/project-tds-virtual-ta-q1.webp):\n\n![Screenshot](images/project-tds-virtual-ta-q1.webp)\n\nThe response must be a JSON object like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"You must use `gpt-3.5-turbo-0125`, even if the AI Proxy only supports `gpt-4o-mini`. Use the OpenAI API directly for this question.\",\n  \"links\": [\n    {\n      \"url\": \"https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga5-question-8-clarification/155939/4\",\n      \"text\": \"Use the model that’s mentioned in the question.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"url\": \"https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga5-question-8-clarification/155939/3\",\n      \"text\": \"My understanding is that you just have to use a tokenizer, similar to what Prof. Anand used, to get the number of tokens and multiply that by the given rate.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe response must be sent within 30 seconds.\n\n## Evaluate your application\n\nHere are a few [sample questions and evaluation parameters](project-tds-virtual-ta-promptfoo.yaml \":ignore\"). These are **indicative**. The actual evaluation could ask _any_ realistic student question.\n\nTo run this:\n\n1. Edit [`project-tds-virtual-ta-promptfoo.yaml`](project-tds-virtual-ta-promptfoo.yaml \":ignore\") to replace `providers[0].config.url` with your API URL.\n2. Run this script:\n\n   ```bash\n   npx -y promptfoo eval --config project-tds-virtual-ta-promptfoo.yaml\n   ```\n\n## Deploy your application\n\nDeploy your application to a public URL that can be accessed by anyone. You may use any platform.\n\n(If you use ngrok, ensure that it is running continuously until you get your results.)\n\n## Share your code\n\n- [Create a new _public_ GitHub repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository)\n- [Add an MIT `LICENSE` file](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository)\n- Commit and push your code\n\n## Submit your URL\n\nSubmit your GitHub repository URL and your API endpoint URL at https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-project-virtual-ta\n\n## Evaluation\n\n- **Pre-requisites**: Your repository **MUST** meet the following criteria to be eligible for evaluation\n  - Your GitHub repository exists and is publicly accessible\n  - Your GitHub repository has a `LICENSE` file with the MIT license in the root folder\n- We will use a modified version of [`project-tds-virtual-ta-promptfoo.yaml`](project-tds-virtual-ta-promptfoo.yaml \":ignore\") with 10 realistic questions. Correct answers will be awarded up to 2 marks each.\n- Your score will be the sum of the marks above. No normalization. What you get is what you get.\n\nBonus:\n\n- 1 mark if your GitHub repo includes a script that scrapes the Discourse posts across a date range from a Discourse course page like [TDS](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/c/courses/tds-kb/34)\n- 2 marks if we deploy your solution (with minimal modifications) as an official solution for students to use.\n"

    "content": "## Crawling with the CLI\n\nSince websites are a common source of data, we often download entire websites (crawling) and then process them offline.\n\nWeb crawling is essential in many data-driven scenarios:\n\n- **Data mining and analysis**: Gathering structured data from multiple pages for market research, competitive analysis, or academic research\n- **Content archiving**: Creating offline copies of websites for preservation or backup purposes\n- **SEO analysis**: Analyzing site structure, metadata, and content to improve search rankings\n- **Legal compliance**: Capturing website content for regulatory or compliance documentation\n- **Website migration**: Creating a complete copy before moving to a new platform or design\n- **Offline access**: Downloading educational resources, documentation, or reference materials for use without internet connection\n\nThe most commonly used tool for fetching websites is [`wget`](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/). It is pre-installed in many UNIX distributions and easy to install.\n\n[![Scraping Websites using Wget (8 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pLfH5TZBGXo/sddefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/pLfH5TZBGXo)\n\nTo crawl the [IIT Madras Data Science Program website](https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/) for example, you could run:\n\n```bash\nwget \\\n  --recursive \\\n  --level=3 \\\n  --no-parent \\\n  --convert-links \\\n  --adjust-extension \\\n  --compression=auto \\\n  --accept html,htm \\\n  --directory-prefix=./ds \\\n  https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/\n```\n\nHere's what each option does:\n\n- `--recursive`: Enables recursive downloading (following links)\n- `--level=3`: Limits recursion depth to 3 levels from the initial URL\n- `--no-parent`: Restricts crawling to only URLs below the initial directory\n- `--convert-links`: Converts all links in downloaded documents to work locally\n- `--adjust-extension`: Adds proper extensions to files (.html, .jpg, etc.) based on MIME types\n- `--compression=auto`: Automatically handles compressed content (gzip, deflate)\n- `--accept html,htm`: Only downloads files with these extensions\n- `--directory-prefix=./ds`: Saves all downloaded files to the specified directory\n\n[wget2](https://gitlab.com/gnuwget/wget2) is a better version of `wget` and supports HTTP2, parallel connections, and only updates modified sites. The syntax is (mostly) the same.\n\n```bash\nwget2 \\\n  --recursive \\\n  --level=3 \\\n  --no-parent \\\n  --convert-links \\\n  --adjust-extension \\\n  --compression=auto \\\n  --accept html,htm \\\n  --directory-prefix=./ds \\\n  https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/\n```\n\nThere are popular free and open-source alternatives to Wget:\n\n### Wpull\n\n[Wpull](https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/wpull) is a wget‐compatible Python crawler that supports on-disk resumption, WARC output, and PhantomJS integration.\n\n```bash\nuvx wpull \\\n  --recursive \\\n  --level=3 \\\n  --no-parent \\\n  --convert-links \\\n  --adjust-extension \\\n  --compression=auto \\\n  --accept html,htm \\\n  --directory-prefix=./ds \\\n  https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/\n```\n\n### HTTrack\n\n[HTTrack](https://www.httrack.com/html/fcguide.html) is dedicated website‐mirroring tool with rich filtering and link‐conversion options.\n\n```bash\nhttrack \"https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/\" \\\n  -O \"./ds\" \\\n  \"+*.study.iitm.ac.in/ds/*\" \\\n  -r3\n```\n\n### Robots.txt\n\n`robots.txt` is a standard file found in a website's root directory that specifies which parts of the site should not be accessed by web crawlers. It's part of the Robots Exclusion Protocol, an ethical standard for web crawling.\n\n**Why it's important**:\n\n- **Server load protection**: Prevents excessive traffic that could overload servers\n- **Privacy protection**: Keeps sensitive or private content from being indexed\n- **Legal compliance**: Respects website owners' rights to control access to their content\n- **Ethical web citizenship**: Shows respect for website administrators' wishes\n\n**How to override robots.txt restrictions**:\n\n- **wget, wget2**: Use `-e robots=off`\n- **httrack**: Use `-s0`\n- **wpull**: Use `--no-robots`\n\n**When to override robots.txt (use with discretion)**:\n\nOnly bypass `robots.txt` when:\n\n- You have explicit permission from the website owner\n- You're crawling your own website\n- The content is publicly accessible and your crawling won't cause server issues\n- You're conducting authorized security testing\n\nRemember that bypassing `robots.txt` without legitimate reason may:\n\n- Violate terms of service\n- Lead to IP banning\n- Result in legal consequences in some jurisdictions\n- Cause reputation damage to your organization\n\nAlways use the minimum necessary crawling speed and scope, and consider contacting website administrators for permission when in doubt.\n"

For example:\n\n- **Content analysis**: Extract clean text from HTML for natural language processing\n- **Data mining**: Strip formatting to focus on the actual content\n- **Offline reading**: Convert web pages to readable formats for e-readers or offline consumption\n- **Content migration**: Move content between different CMS platforms\n- **SEO analysis**: Extract headings, content structure, and text for optimization\n- **Archive creation**: Store web content in more compact, preservation-friendly formats\n- **Accessibility**: Convert content to formats that work better with screen readers\n\nThis tutorial covers both converting existing HTML files and combining web crawling with HTML-to-text conversion in a single workflow -- all using the command line.\n\n### defuddle-cli\n\n[defuddle-cli](https://github.com/defuddle/defuddle) specializes in HTML - Markdown conversion. It's a bit slow and not very customizable but produces clean Markdown that preserves structure, links, and basic formatting. Best for content where preserving the document structure is important.\n\n```bash\nfind . -name '*.html' -exec npx --package defuddle-cli -y defuddle parse {} --md -o {}.md \\;\n```\n\n- `find . -name '*.html'`: Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories\n- `-exec ... \\;`: Executes the following command for each file found\n- `npx --package defuddle-cli -y`: Installs and runs defuddle-cli without prompting\n- `defuddle parse {} --md`: Parses the HTML file (represented by `{}`) and converts to markdown\n- `-o {}.md`: Outputs to a file with the original name plus .md extension\n\n### Pandoc\n\n[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) is a bit slow and highly customizable, preserving almost all formatting elements, leading to verbose markdown. Best for academic or documentation conversion where precision matters.\n\nPandoc can convert from many other formats (such as Word, PDF, LaTeX, etc.) to Markdown and vice versa, making it one of most popular and versatele document convertors.\n\n[![How to Convert a Word Document to Markdown for Free using Pandoc (12 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HPSK7q13-40/sddefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/HPSK7q13-40)\n\n```bash\nfind . -name '*.html' -exec pandoc -f html -t markdown_strict -o {}.md {} \\;\n```\n\n- `find . -name '*.html'`: Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories\n- `-exec ... \\;`: Executes the following command for each file found\n- `pandoc`: The Swiss Army knife of document conversion\n- `-f html -t markdown_strict`: Convert from HTML format to strict markdown\n- `-o {}.md {}`: Output to a markdown file, with the input file as the last argument\n\n### Lynx\n\n[Lynx](https://lynx.invisible-island.net/) is fast and generates text (not Markdown) with minimal formatting. Lynx renders the HTML as it would appear in a text browser, preserving basic structure but losing complex formatting. Best for quick content extraction or when processing large numbers of files.\n\n```bash\nfind . -type f -name '*.html' -exec sh -c 'for f; do lynx -dump -nolist \"$f\" > \"${f%.html}.txt\"; done' _ {} +\n```\n\n- `find . -type f -name '*.html'`: Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories\n- `-exec sh -c '...' _ {} +`: Executes a shell command with batched files for efficiency\n- `for f; do ... done`: Loops through each file in the batch\n- `lynx -dump -nolist \"$f\"`: Uses the lynx text browser to render HTML as plain text\n  - `-dump`: Output the rendered page to stdout\n  - `-nolist`: Don't include the list of links at the end\n- `> \"${f%.html}.txt\"`: Save output to a .txt file with the same base name\n\n### w3m\n\n[w3m](https://w3m.sourceforge.net/) is very slow processing with minimal formatting. w3m tends to be more thorough in its rendering than lynx but takes considerably longer. It supports basic JavaScript processing, making it better at handling modern websites with dynamic content. Best for cases where you need slightly better rendering than lynx, particularly for complex layouts and tables, and when some JavaScript processing is beneficial.\n\n```bash\nfind . -type f -name '*.html' \\\n  -exec sh -c 'for f; do \\\n      w3m -dump -T text/html -cols 80 -no-graph \"$f\" > \"${f%.html}.md\"; \\\n    done' _ {} +\n```\n\n- `find . -type f -name '*.html'`: Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories\n- `-exec sh -c '...' _ {} +`: Executes a shell command with batched files for efficiency\n- `for f; do ... done`: Loops through each file in the batch\n- `w3m -dump -T text/html -cols 80 -no-graph \"$f\"`: Uses the w3m text browser to render HTML\n  - `-dump`: Output the rendered page to stdout\n  - `-T text/html`: Specify input format as HTML\n  - `-cols 80`: Set output width to 80 columns\n  - `-no-graph`: Don't show graphic characters for tables and frames\n- `> \"${f%.html}.md\"`: Save output to a .md file with the same base name\n\n### Comparison\n\n| Approach     | Speed     | Format Quality | Preservation                       | Best For                        |\n| ------------ | --------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |\n| defuddle-cli | Slow      | High           | Good structure and links           | Content migration, publishing   |\n| pandoc       | Slow      | Very High      | Almost everything                  | Academic papers, documentation  |\n| lynx         | Fast      | Low            | Basic structure only               | Quick extraction, large batches |\n| w3m          | Very Slow | Medium-Low     | Basic structure with better tables | Improved readability over lynx  |\n\n### Optimize Batch Processing\n\n1. **Process in parallel**: Use GNU Parallel for multi-core processing:\n\n   ```bash\n   find . -name \"*.html\" | parallel \"pandoc -f html -t markdown_strict -o {}.md {}\"\n   ```\n\n2. **Filter files before processing**:\n\n   ```bash\n   find . -name \"*.html\" -type f -size -1M -exec pandoc -f html -t markdown {} -o {}.md \\;\n   ```\n\n3. **Customize output format** with additional parameters:\n\n   ```bash\n   # For pandoc, preserve line breaks but simplify other formatting\n   find . -name \"*.html\" -exec pandoc -f html -t markdown --wrap=preserve --atx-headers {} -o {}.md \\;\n   ```\n\n4. **Handle errors gracefully**:\n\n   ```bash\n   find . -name \"*.html\" -exec sh -c 'for f; do pandoc -f html -t markdown \"$f\" -o \"${f%.html}.md\" 2>/dev/null || echo \"Failed: $f\" >> conversion_errors.log; done' _ {} +\n   ```\n\n### Choosing the Right Tool\n\n- **Need speed with minimal formatting?** Use the lynx approach\n- **Need precise, complete conversion?** Use pandoc\n- **Need a balance of structure and cleanliness?** Try defuddle-cli\n- **Working with complex tables?** w3m might render them better\n\nRemember that the best approach depends on your specific use case, volume of files, and how you intend to use the converted text.\n\n### Combined Crawling and Conversion\n\nSometimes you need to both crawl a website and convert its content to markdown or text in a single workflow, like [Crawl4AI](#crawl4ai) or [markdown-crawler](#markdown-crawler).\n\n1. **For research/data collection**: Use a specialized crawler (like Crawl4AI) with post-processing conversion\n2. **For simple website archiving**: Markdown-crawler provides a convenient all-in-one solution\n3. **For high-quality conversion**: Use wget/wget2 for crawling followed by pandoc for conversion\n4. **For maximum speed**: Combine wget with lynx in a pipeline\n\n### Crawl4AI\n\n[Crawl4AI](https://github.com/crawl4ai/crawl4ai) is designed for single-page extraction with high-quality content processing. Crawl4AI is optimized for AI training data extraction, focusing on clean, structured content rather than complete site preservation. It excels at removing boilerplate content and preserving the main article text.\n\n```bash\nuv venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate.fish\nuv pip install crawl4ai\ncrawl4ai-setup\n```\n\n- `uv venv`: Creates a Python virtual environment using uv (a faster alternative to virtualenv)\n- `source .venv/bin/activate.fish`: Activates the virtual environment (fish shell syntax)\n- `uv pip install crawl4ai`: Installs the crawl4ai package\n- `crawl4ai-setup`: Initializes crawl4ai's required dependencies\n\n### markdown-crawler\n\n[markdown-crawler](https://pypi.org/project/markdown-crawler/) combines web crawling with markdown conversion in one tool. It's efficient for bulk processing but tends to produce lower-quality markdown conversion compared to specialized converters like pandoc or defuddle. Best for projects where quantity and integration are more important than perfect formatting.\n\n```bash\nuv venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate.fish\nuv pip install markdown-crawler\nmarkdown-crawler -t 5 -d 3 -b ./markdown https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/\n```\n\n- `uv venv` and activation: Same as above\n- `uv pip install markdown-crawler`: Installs the markdown-crawler package\n- `markdown-crawler`: Runs the crawler with these options:\n  - `-t 5`: Sets 5 threads for parallel crawling\n  - `-d 3`: Limits crawl depth to 3 levels\n  - `-b ./markdown`: Sets the base output directory\n  - Final argument is the starting URL\n"

    "title": "Convert Pdfs To Markdown",
    "url": "https://tds.s-anand.net/#/convert-pdfs-to-markdown",
    "content": "## Converting PDFs to Markdown\n\nPDF documents are ubiquitous in academic, business, and technical contexts, but extracting and repurposing their content can be challenging. This tutorial explores various command-line tools for converting PDFs to Markdown format, with a focus on preserving structure and formatting suitable for different use cases, including preparation for Large Language Models (LLMs).\n\nUse Cases:\n\n- **LLM training and fine-tuning**: Create clean text data from PDFs for AI model training\n- **Knowledge base creation**: Transform PDFs into searchable, editable markdown documents\n- **Content repurposing**: Convert academic papers and reports for web publication\n- **Data extraction**: Pull structured content from PDF documents for analysis\n- **Accessibility**: Convert PDFs to more accessible formats for screen readers\n- **Citation and reference management**: Extract bibliographic information from academic papers\n- **Documentation conversion**: Transform technical PDFs into maintainable documentation\n\n### PyMuPDF4LLM\n\n[PyMuPDF4LLM](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pymupdf4llm/) is a specialized component of the PyMuPDF library that generates Markdown specifically formatted for Large Language Models. It produces high-quality markdown with good preservation of document structure. It's specifically optimized for producing text that works well with LLMs, removing irrelevant formatting while preserving semantic structure. Requires PyTorch, which adds dependencies but enables more advanced processing capabilities.\n\nPyMuPDF4LLM uses [MuPDF](https://mupdf.com/) as its PDF parsing engine. [PyMuPDF](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/) is emerging as a strong default for PDF text extraction due to its accuracy and performance in handling complex PDF structures.\n\n```bash\nPYTHONUTF8=1 uv run --with pymupdf4llm python -c 'import pymupdf4llm; h = open(\"pymupdf4llm.md\", \"w\"); h.write(pymupdf4llm.to_markdown(\"$FILE.pdf\"))'\n```\n\n- `PYTHONUTF8=1`: Forces Python to use UTF-8 encoding regardless of system locale\n- `uv run --with pymupdf4llm`: Uses uv package manager to run Python with the pymupdf4llm package\n- `python -c '...'`: Executes Python code directly from the command line\n- `import pymupdf4llm`: Imports the PDF-to-Markdown module\n- `h = open(\"pymupdf4llm.md\", \"w\")`: Creates a file to write the markdown output\n- `h.write(pymupdf4llm.to_markdown(\"$FILE.pdf\"))`: Converts the PDF to markdown and writes to file\n\n## Markitdown\n\n[![Microsoft MarkItDown - Convert Files and Office Documents to Markdown - Install Locally (9 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v65Oyddfxeg/sddefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/v65Oyddfxeg)\n\n[Markitdown](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown) is Microsoft's tool for converting various document formats to Markdown, including PDFs, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, and ZIP files. It's a versatile multi-format converter that handles PDFs via PDFMiner, DOCX via Mammoth, XLSX via Pandas, and PPTX via Python-PPTX. Good for batch processing of mixed document types. The quality of PDF conversion is generally good but may struggle with complex layouts or heavily formatted documents.\n\n```bash\nPYTHONUTF8=1 uvx markitdown $FILE.pdf > markitdown.md\n```\n\n- `PYTHONUTF8=1`: Forces Python to use UTF-8 encoding\n- `uvx markitdown`: Runs the markitdown tool via the uv package manager\n- `$FILE.pdf`: The input PDF file\n- `> markitdown.md`: Redirects output to a markdown file\n\n### Unstructured\n\n[Unstructured](https://unstructured.io/) is rapidly becoming the de facto library for parsing over 40 different file types. It is excellent for extracting text and tables from diverse document formats. Particularly useful for generating clean content to pass to LLMs. Strong community support and actively maintained.\n\n## GROBID\n\nIf you specifically need to parse references from text-native PDFs or reliably OCR'ed ones, [GROBID](https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid) remains the de facto choice. It excels at extracting structured bibliographic information with high accuracy.\n\n```bash\n# Start GROBID service\ndocker run -t --rm -p 8070:8070 lfoppiano/grobid:0.7.2\n\n# Process PDF with curl\ncurl -X POST -F \"input=@paper.pdf\" localhost:8070/api/processFulltextDocument > references.tei.xml\n```\n\n### Mistral OCR API\n\n[Mistral OCR](https://mistral.ai/products/ocr/) offers an end-to-end cloud API that preserves both text and layout, making it easier to isolate specific sections like References. It shows the most promise currently, though it requires post-processing.\n\n## Azure Document Intelligence API\n\nFor enterprise users already in the Microsoft ecosystem, [Azure Document Intelligence](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/document-intelligence) provides excellent raw OCR with enterprise SLAs. May require custom model training or post-processing to match GROBID's reference extraction capabilities.\n\n### Other libraries\n\n[Docling](https://github.com/DS4SD/docling) is IBM's document understanding library that supports PDF conversion. It can be challenging to install, particularly on Windows and some Linux distributions. Offers advanced document understanding capabilities beyond simple text extraction.\n\n[MegaParse](https://github.com/QuivrHQ/MegaParse) takes a comprehensive approach using LibreOffice, Pandoc, Tesseract OCR, and other tools. It has Robust handling of different document types but requires an OpenAI API key for some features. Good for complex documents but has significant dependencies.\n\n## Comparison of PDF-to-Markdown Tools\n\n| Tool         | Strengths                                | Weaknesses                   | Best For                             |\n| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |\n| PyMuPDF4LLM  | Structure preservation, LLM optimization | Requires PyTorch             | AI training data, semantic structure |\n| Markitdown   | Multi-format support, simple usage       | Less precise layout handling | Batch processing, mixed documents    |\n| Unstructured | Wide format support, active development  | Can be resource-intensive    | Production pipelines, integration    |\n| GROBID       | Reference extraction excellence          | Narrower use case            | Academic papers, citations           |\n| Docling      | Advanced document understanding          | Installation difficulties    | Research applications                |\n| MegaParse    | Comprehensive approach                   | Requires OpenAI API          | Complex documents, OCR needs         |\n\nHow to pick:\n\n- **Need LLM-ready content?** PyMuPDF4LLM is specifically designed for this\n- **Working with multiple document formats?** Markitdown handles diverse inputs\n- **Extracting academic references?** GROBID remains the standard\n- **Building a production pipeline?** Unstructured offers the best integration options\n- **Handling complex layouts?** Consider commercial OCR like Mistral or Azure Document Intelligence\n\nThe optimal approach depends on your specific requirements regarding accuracy, structure preservation, and the intended use of the extracted content.\n\n## Tips for Optimal PDF Conversion\n\n1. **Pre-process PDFs** when possible:\n\n   ```bash\n   # Optimize a PDF for text extraction first\n   ocrmypdf --optimize 3 --skip-text input.pdf optimized.pdf\n   ```\n\n2. **Try multiple tools** on the same document to compare results:\n\n3. **Handle scanned PDFs** appropriately:\n\n   ```bash\n   # For scanned documents, run OCR first\n   ocrmypdf --force-ocr input.pdf ocr_ready.pdf\n   PYTHONUTF8=1 uvx markitdown ocr_ready.pdf > markitdown.md\n   ```\n\n4. **Consider post-processing** for better results:\n\n   ```bash\n   # Simple post-processing example\n   sed -i 's/\\([A-Z]\\)\\./\\1\\.\\n/g' output.md  # Add line breaks after sentences\n   ```\n"

They're easily parallelizable.\n- **Popular**: Most systems and languages support shell commands.\n\nIn [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1KSFkQDK0v__XWaAaHKeQuIAwYV0dkTe8), we'll explore log files with these shell-based commands.\n\n## Download logs\n\n[This file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J1ed4iHFAiS1Xq55aP858OEyEMQ-uMnE/view) has Apache web server logs for the site [s-anand.net](https://s-anand.net/) in the month of April 2024.\n\nYou can download files using `wget` or `curl`. One of these is usually available by default on most systems.\n\nWe'll use `curl` to download the file from the URL `https://drive.usercontent.google.com/uc?id=1J1ed4iHFAiS1Xq55aP858OEyEMQ-uMnE&export=download`\n\n```python\n# curl has LOTs of options.

(powers of 1000).\n    Binary prefixes can be used, too: KiB=K, MiB=M, and so on.\n\n    The TIME_STYLE argument can be full-iso, long-iso, iso, locale, or +FORMAT.\n    FORMAT is interpreted like in date(1).  If FORMAT is FORMAT1<newline>FORMAT2,\n    then FORMAT1 applies to non-recent files and FORMAT2 to recent files.\n    TIME_STYLE prefixed with 'posix-' takes effect only outside the POSIX locale.\n    Also the TIME_STYLE environment variable sets the default style to use.\n\n    Using color to distinguish file types is disabled both by default and\n    with --color=never.  With --color=auto, ls emits color codes only when\n    standard output is connected to a terminal.  The LS_COLORS environment\n    variable can change the settings.  Use the dircolors command to set it.\n\n    Exit status:\n     0  if OK,\n     1  if minor problems (e.g., cannot access subdirectory),\n     2  if serious trouble (e.g., cannot access command-line argument).\n\n    GNU coreutils online help: <https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/>\n    Full documentation <https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/ls>\n    or available locally via: info '(coreutils) ls invocation'\n\n```python\n# By default, it just lists all file names\n!ls\n```\n\n    sample_data  s-anand.net-Apr-2024.gz\n\n```python\n# If we want to see the size of the file, use `-l` for the long-listing format\n!ls -l\n```\n\n    total 5672\n    drwxr-xr-x 1 root root    4096 Jun  6 14:21 sample_data\n    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 5801198 Jun  9 05:18 s-anand.net-Apr-2024.gz\n\n## Uncompress the log file\n\n`gzip` is the most popular compression format on the web. It's fast and pretty good. (`xz` is much better but slower.)\n\nSince the file has a `.gz` extension, we know it's compressed using `gzip`. We can use `gzip -d FILE.gz` to decompress the file. It'll replace `FILE.gz` with `FILE`.\n\n(Compression works the opposite way. `gzip FILE` replaces `FILE` with `FILE.gz`)[link text](https://)\n\n```python\n# gzip -d is the same as gunzip. They both decompress a GZIP-ed file\n!gzip -d s-anand.net-Apr-2024.gz\n```\n\n```python\n# Let's list the files and see the size\n!ls -l\n```\n\n    total 50832\n    drwxr-xr-x 1 root root     4096 Jun  6 14:21 sample_data\n    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 52044491 Jun  9 05:18 s-anand.net-Apr-2024\n\nIn this case, a file that was ~5.8MiB became ~52MiB, roughly 10 times larger.

It has a lot of data. Some are clear. For example, taking the last row:\n\n- `37.59.21.100` is the IP address that made a request. That's from [OVH](https://www.whois.com/whois/37.59.21.100) - a French cloud provider. Maybe a bot.\n- `[30/Apr/2024:07:11:31 -0500]` is the time of the request\n- `\"GET /blog/2003-mumbai-bloggers-meet-photos/feed/ HTTP/1.1\"` is the request made to [this page](https://s-anand.net/blog/2003-mumbai-bloggers-meet-photos/feed/)\n- `200` is the HTTP reponse status code, indicating that all's well\n- `686` bytes was the size of the response\n- `\"Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/30.0.1599.66 Safari/537.36\"` is the user agent. That's Chrome 30 -- a really old versio of Chrome on Linux. Very likely a bot.\n\n## Count requests\n\n`wc` counts the number of lines, words, and characters in a file. The number of lines is most often used with data.\n\n```python\n!wc s-anand.net-Apr-2024\n```\n\n      208539  4194545 52044491 s-anand.net-Apr-2024\n\nSo, in Apr 2024, there were ~208K requests to the site. Useful to know.\n\nI wonder: **Who is sending most of these requests?**\n\nLet's extract the IP addresses and count them.\n\n## Extract the `IP` column\n\nWe'll use `cut` to cut the first column. It has 2 options that we'll use.\n\n`--delimiter` is the character that splits fields. In the log file, it's a space. (We'll confirm this shortly.)\n`--fields` picks the field to cut. We want field 1 (IP address)\n\nLet's preview this:\n\n```python\n# Preview just the IP addresses from the logs\n!cut --delimiter \" \" --fields 1 s-anand.net-Apr-2024 | head -n 5\n```\n\n    17.241.219.11\n    17.241.75.154\n    101.44.248.120\n    17.241.227.200\n    37.59.21.100\n\nWe used the `|` operator. That passes the output to the next command, `head -n 5`, and gives us first 5 lines. This is called **piping** and is the equivalent of calling a function inside another in programming languages.\n\nWe'll use `sort` to sort these IP addresses. That puts the same IP addresses next to each other.\n\n```python\n# Preview the SORTED IP addresses from the logs\n!cut --delimiter \" \" --fields 1 s-anand.net-Apr-2024 | sort | head -n 5\n```\n\n    100.20.65.50\n    100.43.111.139\n    101.100.145.51\n    101.115.156.11\n    101.115.205.68\n\nThere are no duplicates there... maybe we need to go a bit further?

So let's `sort` it further.\n\n`sort` has an option `--key 1n` that sorts by field `1` -- the count of IP addresses in this case. The `n` indicates that it's a numeric sort (so 11 appears AFTER 2).\n\nAlso, we'll use `tail` instead of `head` to get the highest entries.\n\n```python\n# Show the top 5 IP addresses by visits\n!cut --delimiter \" \" --fields 1 s-anand.net-Apr-2024 | sort | uniq --count | sort --key 1n | tail -n 5\n```\n\n       2560 66.249.70.6\n       3010 148.251.241.12\n       4245 35.86.164.73\n       7800 37.59.21.100\n     101255 136.243.228.193\n\nWOW!

Is it something that identifies itself as a bot of some kind?\n\n## Find lines matching an IP\n\n`grep` searches for text in files. It uses [Regular Expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions) which are a powerful set of wildcards.\n\n💡 TIP: You **MUST** learn regular expressions. They're very helpful.\n\nHere, we'll search for all lines BEGINNING with 136.243.228.193 and having a space after that. That's `\"^136.243.228.193 \"`. The `^` at the beginning matches the start of a line.\n\n```python\n# Preview lines that begin with 136.243.228.193\n!grep \"^136.243.228.193 \" s-anand.net-Apr-2024 | head -n 5\n```\n\n    136.243.228.193 - - [31/Mar/2024:11:27:43 -0500] \"GET /kannadamp3 HTTP/1.1\" 200 4162 \"-\" \"Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; DataForSeoBot/1.0; +https://dataforseo.com/dataforseo-bot)\" www.s-anand.net 192.254.190.216\n    136.243.228.193 - - [31/Mar/2024:11:31:07 -0500] \"GET /kannadamp3 HTTP/1.1\" 200 4162 \"-\" \"Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; DataForSeoBot/1.0; +https://dataforseo.com/dataforseo-bot)\" www.s-anand.net 192.254.190.216\n    136.243.228.193 - - [03/Apr/2024:17:46:42 -0500] \"GET /robots.txt HTTP/1.1\" 200 195 \"-\" \"Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; DataForSeoBot/1.0; +https://dataforseo.com/dataforseo-bot)\" www.s-anand.net 192.254.190.216\n    136.243.228.193 - - [06/Apr/2024:02:58:43 -0500] \"GET /Statistically_improbable_phrases.html HTTP/1.1\" 301 - \"-\" \"Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; DataForSeoBot/1.0; +https://dataforseo.com/dataforseo-bot)\" www.s-anand.net 192.254.190.216\n    136.243.228.193 - - [08/Apr/2024:22:38:25 -0500] \"GET /robots.txt HTTP/1.1\" 200 195 \"-\" \"Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; DataForSeoBot/1.0; +https://dataforseo.com/dataforseo-bot)\" www.s-anand.net 192.254.190.216\n\nThese requests have clearly identified themselves as `DataForSeoBot/1.0`, which is helpful.

That seems to be from OVH, a French cloud hosting provider.

What are the user agents that DO identify themselves as bots? Let's use `grep` to find all words that match bot.\n\n`grep --only-matching` will show only the matches, not the entire line.\n\nThe regular expression `'\\S*bot\\S*'` (which ChatGPT generated) finds all words that have bot.\n\n- `\\S` matches non-space characters\n- `\\S*` matches 0 or more non-space characters\n\n```python\n# Find all words with `bot` in it\n!grep --only-matching '\\b\\w*bot\\w*\\b' s-anand.net-Apr-2024 | head\n```\n\n    Applebot\n    applebot\n    Applebot\n    applebot\n    Applebot\n    applebot\n    Applebot\n    applebot\n    Applebot\n    applebot\n\n```python\n# Count frequency of all words with `bot` in it and show the top 10\n!grep --only-matching '\\S*bot\\S*' s-anand.net-Apr-2024 | sort | uniq --count | sort --key 1n | tail\n```\n\n       4134 PetalBot;+https://webmaster.petalsearch.com/site/petalbot)\"\n       4307 /robots.txt\n       5664 bingbot/2.0;\n       5664 +http://www.bing.com/bingbot.htm)\n       8771 +claudebot@anthropic.com)\"\n       8827 +http://www.google.com/bot.html)\"\n       8830 Googlebot/2.1;\n      13798 (Applebot/0.1;\n      13798 +http://www.apple.com/go/applebot)\"\n     101262 +https://dataforseo.com/dataforseo-bot)\"\n\nThat gives me a rough sense of who's crawling my site.\n\n1. [DataForSEO](https://dataforseo.com/)\n2. [Apple](https://www.apple.com/)\n3. [Google](https://www.google.com/)\n4. [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/)\n5. [Bing](https://www.bing.com/)\n6. [PetalBot](https://aspiegel.com/petalbot)\n\n## Convert logs to CSV\n\nThis file is _almost_ a CSV file separated by spaces instead of commas.\n\nThe main problem is the date. Instead of `[31/Mar/2024:11:27:43 -0500]` it should have been `\"31/Mar/2024:11:27:43 -0500\"`\n\nWe'll use `sed` (stream editor) to replace the characters. `sed` is like `grep` but lets you replace, not just search.\n\n(Actually, `sed` can do a lot more. It's a full-fledged editor. You can insert, delete, edit, etc. programmatically. In fact, `sed` has truly remarkable features that this paragraph is too small to contain.)\n\nThe regular expression we will use is `\\[\\([^]]*\\)\\]`. The way this works is:\n\n- `\\[`: Match the opening square bracket.\n- `\\([^]]*\\)`: Capture everything inside the square brackets (non-greedy match for any character except `]`).\n- `\\]`: Match the closing square bracket.\n\nBTW, I didn't create this. [ChatGPT did](https://chatgpt.com/share/7f14e9d2-15ec-4562-b263-61547d2230f3).\n\n`sed \"s/abc/xyz/\" FILE` replaces `abc` with `xyz` in the file. We can use the regular expression above for the search and `\"\\1\"` for the value -- it inserts captured group enclosed in double quotes.\n\n```python\n# Replace [datetime] etc. with \"datetime\" and save as log.csv\n!sed 's/\\[\\([^]]*\\)\\]/\"\\1\"/' s-anand.net-Apr-2024 > log.csv\n```\n\n```python\n# We should now have a log.csv that's roughly the same size as the original file.\n!ls -l\n```\n\n    total 101660\n    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 52044491 Jun  9 05:19 log.csv\n    drwxr-xr-x 1 root root     4096 Jun  6 14:21 sample_data\n    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 52044491 Jun  9 05:18 s-anand.net-Apr-2024\n\nYou can download this `log.csv` and open it in Excel as a CSV file with space as the delimiter.\n\nBut when I did that, I faced another problem. Some of the lines had extra columns.\n\nThat's because the \"User Agent\" values sometimes contain a quote. CSV files are supposed to escape quotes with `\"\"` -- two double quotes. But Apache uses `\\\"` instead.\n\nI'll leave it as an exercise for you to fix that.\n\n## More commands\n\nWe've covered the commands most often used to process data before analysis.\n\nHere are a few more that you'll find useful.\n\n- `cat` concatenates multiple files. You can join multiple log files with this, for example\n- `awk` is almost a full-fledged programming interface. It's often used for summing up values\n- `less` lets you open and read files, scrolling through it\n\nYou can read the book [Data Science at the Command Line](https://jeroenjanssens.com/dsatcl/) for more tools and examples.\n"

It handles various formats (PNG, JPEG, GIF, etc.) and provides operations from basic resizing to complex filters.\n\nHere's a minimal example showing common operations:\n\n```python\n# /// script\n# requires-python = \">=3.11\"\n# dependencies = [\"Pillow\"]\n# ///\n\nfrom PIL import Image, ImageEnhance, ImageFilter\n\nasync def process_image(path: str) -> Image.Image:\n    \"\"\"Process an image with basic enhancements.\"\"\"\n    with Image.open(path) as img:\n        # Convert to RGB to ensure compatibility\n        img = img.convert('RGB')\n\n        # Resize maintaining aspect ratio\n        img.thumbnail((800, 800))\n\n        # Apply enhancements\n        img = (ImageEnhance.Contrast(img)\n               .enhance(1.2))\n\n        return img.filter(ImageFilter.SHARPEN)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    import asyncio\n    img = asyncio.run(process_image(\"input.jpg\"))\n    img.save(\"output.jpg\", quality=85)\n```\n\nKey features and techniques you'll learn:\n\n- **Image Loading and Saving**: Handle various formats with automatic conversion\n- **Basic Operations**: Resize, rotate, crop, and flip images\n- **Color Manipulation**: Adjust brightness, contrast, and color balance\n- **Filters and Effects**: Apply blur, sharpen, and other visual effects\n- **Drawing**: Add text, shapes, and overlays to images\n- **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple images efficiently\n- **Memory Management**: Process large images without memory issues\n\n### Basic Image Operations\n\nCommon operations for resizing, cropping, and rotating images:\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image\n\nasync def transform_image(\n    path: str,\n    size: tuple[int, int],\n    rotation: float = 0\n) -> Image.Image:\n    \"\"\"Transform image with basic operations.\"\"\"\n    with Image.open(path) as img:\n        # Resize with anti-aliasing\n        img = img.resize(size, Image.LANCZOS)\n\n        # Rotate around center\n        if rotation:\n            img = img.rotate(rotation, expand=True)\n\n        # Auto-crop empty edges\n        img = img.crop(img.getbbox())\n\n        return img\n```\n\n### Color and Enhancement\n\nAdjust image appearance with built-in enhancement tools:\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import ImageEnhance, ImageOps\n\nasync def enhance_image(\n    img: Image.Image,\n    brightness: float = 1.0,\n    contrast: float = 1.0,\n    saturation: float = 1.0\n) -> Image.Image:\n    \"\"\"Apply color enhancements to image.\"\"\"\n    enhancers = [\n        (ImageEnhance.Brightness, brightness),\n        (ImageEnhance.Contrast, contrast),\n        (ImageEnhance.Color, saturation)\n    ]\n\n    for Enhancer, factor in enhancers:\n        if factor != 1.0:\n            img = Enhancer(img).enhance(factor)\n\n    return img\n```\n\n### Filters and Effects\n\nApply visual effects and filters to images:\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import ImageFilter\n\ndef apply_effects(img: Image.Image) -> Image.Image:\n    \"\"\"Apply various filters and effects.\"\"\"\n    effects = {\n        'blur': ImageFilter.GaussianBlur(radius=2),\n        'sharpen': ImageFilter.SHARPEN,\n        'edge': ImageFilter.FIND_EDGES,\n        'emboss': ImageFilter.EMBOSS\n    }\n\n    return {name: img.filter(effect)\n            for name, effect in effects.items()}\n```\n\n### Drawing and Text\n\nAdd text, shapes, and overlays to images:\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image, ImageDraw, ImageFont\n\nasync def add_watermark(\n    img: Image.Image,\n    text: str,\n    font_size: int = 30\n) -> Image.Image:\n    \"\"\"Add text watermark to image.\"\"\"\n    draw = ImageDraw.Draw(img)\n    font = ImageFont.truetype(\"arial.ttf\", font_size)\n\n    # Calculate text size and position\n    text_bbox = draw.textbbox((0, 0), text, font=font)\n    text_width = text_bbox[2] - text_bbox[0]\n    text_height = text_bbox[3] - text_bbox[1]\n\n    # Position text at bottom-right\n    x = img.width - text_width - 10\n    y = img.height - text_height - 10\n\n    # Add text with shadow\n    draw.text((x+2, y+2), text, font=font, fill='black')\n    draw.text((x, y), text, font=font, fill='white')\n\n    return img\n```\n\n### Memory-Efficient Processing\n\nHandle large images without loading them entirely into memory:\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport os\n\nasync def process_large_images(\n    input_dir: str,\n    output_dir: str,\n    max_size: tuple[int, int]\n) -> None:\n    \"\"\"Process multiple large images efficiently.\"\"\"\n    os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)\n\n    for filename in os.listdir(input_dir):\n        if not filename.lower().endswith(('.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg')):\n            continue\n\n        input_path = os.path.join(input_dir, filename)\n        output_path = os.path.join(output_dir, filename)\n\n        with Image.open(input_path) as img:\n            # Process in chunks using thumbnail\n            img.thumbnail(max_size)\n            img.save(output_path, optimize=True)\n```\n\nPractice with these resources:\n\n- [Pillow Documentation](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/): Complete API reference\n- [Python Image Processing Tutorial](https://realpython.com/image-processing-with-the-python-pillow-library/): In-depth guide\n- [Sample Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lamsimon/celebs): Test images for practice\n\nWatch these tutorials for hands-on demonstrations:\n\n[![Image Processing Tutorial for beginners with Python PIL in 30 mins](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dkp4wUhCwR4/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/dkp4wUhCwR4)\n\n### Image Processing with ImageMagick\n\n[ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) is a powerful command-line tool for image manipulation, offering features beyond what's possible with Python libraries.

    "content": "## Data Preparation in DuckDB\n\n[![DuckDB](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/fZj6kTwXN1U/sddefault.webp)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw2SS5iImhEThtiGNPiNenOr2tVvLj6H7)\n\nDuckDB's SQL engine can handle large files quickly. Below are common cleaning tasks using the DuckDB CLI.\n\n### Create a Sample Dataset\n\nLet's create a sample dataset that mimics real business data patterns - incomplete customer records, time-series orders, and regional variations. Before working with messy production data, you need a controlled environment to test data cleaning techniques. This sample represents common e-commerce scenarios: missing customer info (20% of orders), seasonal patterns (15-day cycles), and geographic segmentation that drive business decisions like inventory placement and marketing campaigns.\n\n```bash\nduckdb sample.duckdb <<'SQL'\nCREATE OR REPLACE TABLE orders AS\nSELECT\n  seq AS order_id,\n  CASE WHEN seq % 5 = 0 THEN NULL ELSE 'Customer ' || seq END AS customer,\n  date '2025-01-01' + CAST(seq % 15 AS INTEGER) AS order_date,\n  CASE WHEN seq % 3 = 0 THEN 'Widget ' || seq ELSE 'Gadget ' || seq END AS product,\n  round(random()*1000, 2) AS amount,\n  CASE WHEN seq % 4 = 0 THEN 'EU' ELSE 'US' END AS region\nFROM range(1, 50) tbl(seq);\nSQL\n```\n\n### Create a Messy CSV\n\nLet's also simulate real-world data export issues - unescaped quotes, missing delimiters, and malformed records that break standard CSV parsers. Data rarely arrives clean. Export systems fail, manual data entry introduces errors, and third-party integrations send malformed files. Learning to handle corrupted CSV files prevents hours of debugging and ensures your data pipeline doesn't break when inevitably receiving bad data from vendors, APIs, or legacy systems.\n\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > messy_orders.csv\norder_id,customer,order_date,product,amount,region\n1,Customer 1,2025-01-01,Widget 1,100,US\n\"2,Customer 2,2025-01-02,Gadget 2,200,US\n3,Customer 3,2025-01-03,Gadget 3,300,EU\nEOF\n```\n\n### Create a Big CSV\n\nNext, we'll create a large dataset to practice memory-efficient processing techniques that handle files too big to fit in RAM. When working with millions of customer records, transaction logs, or sensor data, traditional tools crash or run out of memory. DuckDB's streaming capabilities let you process 100GB+ files on laptops by reading data in chunks, making big data analysis accessible without expensive infrastructure.\n\n```bash\nduckdb sample.duckdb <<'SQL'\nCOPY (SELECT seq AS id, random() AS val FROM range(100000)) TO 'big.csv';\nSQL\n```\n\n### Exploratory Data Analysis\n\nWe need to examine our data structure and quality before making business decisions. Every data analysis starts with understanding what you have - missing values can skew customer segmentation, outliers affect revenue forecasting, and data types determine which analytical techniques work. Quick EDA prevents costly mistakes like launching marketing campaigns based on incomplete customer data or setting prices using corrupted transaction amounts.\n\n```sql\n-- Preview and get stats\nSELECT * FROM orders LIMIT 5;\nDESCRIBE orders;\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS n, AVG(amount) AS avg_amount FROM orders;\n```\n\n### Converting Data to Other Formats\n\nLet's export cleaned data to formats optimized for different business needs. Analytics teams need Parquet for fast querying, APIs require JSON for web integration, and executives want CSV for Excel compatibility. Format conversion ensures your cleaned data reaches every stakeholder in their preferred format, enabling faster decision-making across departments without forcing everyone to learn SQL.\n\n```sql\nCOPY (SELECT * FROM orders) TO 'orders.json' (FORMAT JSON);\nCOPY (SELECT * FROM orders) TO 'orders.parquet' (FORMAT PARQUET);\n```\n\n### Reading Messy CSV\n\nWe need to handle corrupted files that would normally crash your data pipeline. Real-world CSV files from vendors, legacy systems, or manual exports often contain malformed rows that break standard parsers. Instead of spending hours manually fixing files or losing critical business data, DuckDB's error handling lets you salvage usable records while identifying problem areas for follow-up with data providers.\n\n```sql\n-- Skip bad lines while loading\nSELECT *\nFROM read_csv_auto('messy_orders.csv', ignore_errors=true);\n```\n\n### Handling Missing Values\n\nIt's important to address incomplete data that could lead to wrong business conclusions. Missing customer names prevent personalized marketing, absent transaction amounts skew revenue calculations, and incomplete addresses block shipping. Rather than excluding entire records and losing valuable information, strategic imputation preserves data for analysis while clearly marking assumptions made during the cleaning process.\n\n```sql\n-- Replace null customer names\nSELECT COALESCE(customer, 'Unknown') AS customer FROM orders;\n```\n\n### String Operations\n\nIt's common to standardize text data that comes from multiple sources with inconsistent formatting. Product names from different suppliers use varying cases, customer entries have extra spaces, and imported data contains mixed formatting. Clean, consistent strings enable accurate grouping for inventory management, prevent duplicate customer records, and ensure search functionality works properly across your application.\n\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT TRIM(LOWER(product)) AS clean_product FROM orders;\n```\n\n### Date Parsing and Conversion\n\nTypically, we transform dates into different formats that enable time-based business analysis. Raw date strings from different systems use various formats that prevent proper sorting and filtering. Converting to standard formats enables monthly sales reporting, seasonal trend analysis, and time-based customer segmentation - critical for inventory planning, marketing campaigns, and financial forecasting.\n\n```sql\nSELECT order_id, STRFTIME(order_date, '%Y-%m') AS order_month FROM orders;\n```\n\n### Conditional Logic and Binning\n\nA common task is to categorize continuous data into meaningful business segments that drive decision-making. Converting exact dollar amounts into price tiers enables targeted marketing (premium vs budget customers), inventory classification (high/medium/low value items), and commission structures. This segmentation forms the foundation for personalized pricing, customer targeting, and performance analysis.\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n  order_id,\n  CASE WHEN amount > 700 THEN 'high' WHEN amount > 300 THEN 'medium' ELSE 'low' END AS price_band\nFROM orders;\n```\n\n### Regex Search and Replace\n\nWe often need to clean complex text patterns that simple string operations can't handle. Product descriptions contain multiple spaces, phone numbers have inconsistent formatting, and addresses mix abbreviations with full words. Regular expressions fix these patterns systematically, ensuring consistent data quality for customer communications, shipping integrations, and search functionality.\n\n```sql\nSELECT REGEXP_REPLACE(product, '\\\\s+', ' ', 'g') AS tidy_product FROM orders;\n```\n\n### Working with Multiple Formats\n\nLet's combine data from different sources that use various file formats. Modern businesses receive data as CSV exports, JSON from APIs, and Parquet from data warehouses. Rather than maintaining separate processing pipelines, DuckDB's format flexibility lets you join orders from your CSV exports with customer data from JSON APIs and inventory levels from Parquet files in a single query.\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE json_orders AS SELECT * FROM read_json_auto('orders.json');\nCREATE TABLE parquet_orders AS SELECT * FROM read_parquet('orders.parquet');\nSELECT * FROM orders UNION ALL SELECT * FROM parquet_orders;\n```\n\n### Processing in Chunks\n\nWe handle massive datasets that exceed available memory by processing them in manageable segments. When analyzing years of transaction logs, customer behavior data, or sensor readings, loading everything at once crashes systems. Chunk processing enables analysis of terabyte-scale datasets on standard hardware, making enterprise-level data analysis accessible for fraud detection, customer lifetime value calculations, and operational analytics.\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM read_csv_auto('big.csv') LIMIT 1000 OFFSET 0;\nSELECT * FROM read_csv_auto('big.csv') LIMIT 1000 OFFSET 1000;\n```\n\n### Filtering Rows and Dropping Columns\n\nWe'll focus analysis on relevant data subsets while removing sensitive or unnecessary information. Business analysis rarely needs all data - marketing teams want current customers, finance needs profitable regions, and product managers focus on active items. Efficient filtering reduces processing time, protects sensitive data (removing PII columns), and ensures analysis focuses on business-relevant subsets rather than getting lost in comprehensive but unfocused datasets.\n\n```sql\nSELECT order_id, amount FROM orders WHERE region = 'US';\nSELECT * EXCLUDE region FROM orders;\n```\n\n### Derived Columns\n\nNow, let's create new business metrics from existing data that drive key performance indicators. Raw transaction amounts become profit margins with tax calculations, customer regions enable territory-based analysis, and dates support seasonal comparisons. These derived metrics power executive dashboards, sales team performance tracking, and automated business rules without requiring manual calculations or separate reporting tools.\n\n```sql\nSELECT *, amount * 0.1 AS tax, UPPER(region) AS region_code FROM orders;\n```\n\n### Summaries and Pivots\n\nA big part of data preparation is to transform detailed transaction data into executive-level insights that inform strategic decisions. Converting thousands of individual orders into regional sales summaries, customer segment performance, and product category trends enables quick identification of growth opportunities, underperforming markets, and inventory optimization needs. These aggregations become the foundation for board presentations, budget planning, and strategic initiatives.\n\n```sql\n-- Aggregation\nSELECT region, COUNT(*) AS n_orders, SUM(amount) AS total FROM orders GROUP BY region;\n\n-- Pivot by region\nSELECT *\nFROM orders\nPIVOT(COUNT(*) FOR region IN ('US', 'EU'));\n```\n\nUseful links:\n\n- [DuckDB Documentation](https://duckdb.org/docs/)\n- [SQL Functions](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/functions/overview)\n- [DuckDB Extensions](https://duckdb.org/docs/extensions/overview)\n"

    "content": "## Parsing JSON\n\nJSON is everywhere—APIs, logs, configuration files—and its nested or large structure can challenge memory and processing. In this tutorial, we'll explore tools to flatten, stream, and query JSON data efficiently.\n\nFor example, we'll often need to process a multi-gigabyte log file from a web service where each record is a JSON object.\n\n[![JSON Parsing in Python](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1lxrb_ezP-g/sddefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/1lxrb_ezP-g)\n\nThis requires us to handle complex nested structures, large files that don't fit in memory, or extract specific fields.

It excels in quick data exploration and can be integrated into shell scripts for automated data pipelines.\n\n**Example:** Sifting through server logs in JSON Lines format to extract error messages or aggregate metrics without launching a full-scale ETL process.\n\n```bash\n# Extract specific fields from JSONL\ncat data.jsonl | jq -c 'select(.type == \"user\") | {id, name}'\n\n# Transform JSON structure\ncat data.json | jq '.items[] | {name: .name, count: .details.count}'\n\n# Filter and aggregate\ncat events.jsonl | jq -s 'group_by(.category) | map({category: .[0].category, count: length})'\n```\n\n### JMESPath Queries\n\n[JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/) offers a declarative query language to extract and transform data from nested JSON structures without needing verbose code. It's a neat alternative when you want to quickly pull out specific values or filter collections based on conditions.\n\n**Example:** Extracting user emails or filtering out inactive records from a complex JSON payload received from a cloud service.\n\n```python\nimport jmespath\n\n# Example queries\ndata = {\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\"name\": \"Seattle\", \"state\": \"WA\", \"info\": {\"population\": 737015}},\n        {\"name\": \"Portland\", \"state\": \"OR\", \"info\": {\"population\": 652503}}\n    ]\n}\n\n# Find all cities with population > 700000\ncities = jmespath.search(\"locations[?info.population > `700000`].name\", data)\n```\n\n### Streaming with ijson\n\nLoading huge JSON files all at once can quickly exhaust system memory. [ijson](https://ijson.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) lets you stream and process JSON incrementally. This method is ideal when your JSON file is too large or when you only need to work with part of the data.\n\n**Example:** Processing a continuous feed from an API that returns a large JSON array, such as sensor data or event logs, while filtering on the fly.\n\n```python\nimport ijson\n\nasync def process_large_json(filepath: str) -> list:\n    \"\"\"Process a large JSON file without loading it entirely into memory.\"\"\"\n    results = []\n\n    with open(filepath, 'rb') as file:\n        # Stream objects under the 'items' key\n        parser = ijson.items(file, 'items.item')\n        async for item in parser:\n            if item['value'] > 100:  # Process conditionally\n                results.append(item)\n\n    return results\n```\n\n### Pandas JSON Columns\n\n[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) makes it easy to work with tabular data that includes JSON strings. When you receive API data where one column holds nested JSON, flattening these structures lets you analyze and visualize the data using familiar DataFrame operations.\n\n**Example:** Flattening customer records stored as nested JSON in a CSV file to extract demographic details and spending patterns.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Parse JSON strings in a column\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'json_col': ['{\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30}', '{\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 25}']})\ndf['parsed'] = df['json_col'].apply(pd.json_normalize)\n\n# Normalize nested JSON columns\ndf = pd.read_csv('data.csv')\ndf_normalized = pd.json_normalize(\n    df['nested_json'].apply(json.loads),\n    record_path=['items'],        # List of nested objects to unpack\n    meta=['id', 'timestamp']      # Keep these columns from parent\n)\n```\n\n### SQL JSON Functions\n\n[SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL:2016) supports built-in JSON functions allow you to query and manipulate JSON stored within relational databases.\nThese are implemented by most popular databases, including\n[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/json1.html),\n[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html), and\n[MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/json-function-reference.html).\nThis is especially handy when you have a hybrid data model, combining structured tables with semi-structured JSON columns.\n\n**Example:** An application that stores user settings or application logs as JSON in a SQLite database, enabling quick lookups and modifications without external JSON parsing libraries.\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n    json_extract(data, '$.name') as name,\n    json_extract(data, '$.details.age') as age\nFROM users\nWHERE json_extract(data, '$.active') = true\n```\n\n### DuckDB JSON Processing\n\n[DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) shines when analyzing JSON/JSONL files directly, making it a powerful tool for data analytics without the overhead of loading entire datasets into memory. Its SQL-like syntax simplifies exploratory analysis on nested data.\n\n**Example:** Performing ad-hoc analytics on streaming JSON logs from a web service, such as calculating average response times or aggregating user behavior metrics.\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n    json_extract_string(data, '$.user.name') as name,\n    avg(json_extract_float(data, '$.metrics.value')) as avg_value\nFROM read_json_auto('data/*.jsonl')\nGROUP BY 1\nHAVING avg_value > 100\n```\n"

This saves the output in JSON as well as SRT format in the source directory.\n\n```bash\nfaster-whisper-xxl --print_progress --output_dir source --batch_recursive \\\n                   --check_files --standard --output_format json srt \\\n                   --model medium --language en $FILE\n```\n\n- `--model`: The OpenAI Whisper model to use. You can choose from:\n  - `tiny`: Fastest but least accurate\n  - `base`: Good for simple audio\n  - `small`: Balanced speed/accuracy\n  - `medium`: Recommended default\n  - `large-v3`: Most accurate but slowest\n- `--output_format`: The output format to use. You can pick multiple formats from:\n  - `json`: Has the most detailed information including timing, text, quality, etc.\n  - `srt`: A popular subtitle format. You can use this in YouTube, for example.\n  - `vtt`: A modern subtitle format.\n  - `txt`: Just the text transcript\n- `--output_dir`: The directory to save the output files. `source` indicates the source directory, i.e. where the input `$FILE` is\n- `--language`: The language of the input file. If you don't specify it, it analyzes the first 30 seconds to auto-detect. You can speed it up by specifying it.\n\nRun `faster-whisper-xxl --help` for more options.\n\n## Gemini transcription\n\nThe [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) models from Google are notable in two ways:\n\n1. They have a _huge_ input context window. Gemini 2.0 Flash can accept 1M tokens, for example.\n2. They can handle audio input.\n\nThis allows us to use Gemini to transcribe audio files.\n\nLLMs are not good at transcribing audio _faithfully_. They tend to correct errors and meander from what was said. But they are intelligent. That enables a few powerful workflows. Here are some examples:\n\n1. **Transcribe into other languages**. Gemini will handle the transcription and translation in a single step.\n2. **Summarize audio transcripts**. For example, convert a podcast into a tutorial, or a meeting recording into actions.\n3. **Legal Proceeding Analysis**.

    "content": "## Serverless hosting: Vercel\n\n<!--\n\nWhy Vercel? I evaluated from https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology#2-cloud-platforms\n\n- AWS, Azure, Google Cloud are too complex for beginners\n- Cloudflare (next most popular, widely admired) Python support is in beta\n- Hetzner (most admired), Supabase (next most admired) do not have a serverless platform\n- Fly.io (next most admired) does not have a free tier\n- Heroku (used in previous terms) is the least admired\n- Vercel is both popular, admired, growing, has a free plan, and a simple API\n\n-->\n\nServerless platforms let you rent a single function instead of an entire machine. They're perfect for small web tools that _don't need to run all the time_. Here are some common real-life uses:\n\n- A contact form that emails you when someone wants to hire you (runs for 2-3 seconds, a few times per day)\n- A tool that converts uploaded photos to black and white (runs for 5-10 seconds when someone uploads a photo)\n- A chatbot that answers basic questions about your business hours (runs for 1-2 seconds per question)\n- A newsletter sign-up that adds emails to your mailing list (runs for 1 second per sign-up)\n- A webhook that posts your Etsy sales to Discord (runs for 1 second whenever you make a sale)\n\nYou only pay when someone uses your tool, and the platform automatically handles busy periods. For example, if 100 people fill out your contact form at once, the platform creates 100 temporary copies of your code to handle them all. When they're done, these copies disappear. It's cheaper than running a full-time server because you're not paying for the time when no one is using your tool - most tools are idle 95% of the time!\n\nRather than writing a full program, serverless platforms let you write functions. These functions are called via HTTP requests. They run in a cloud environment and are scaled up and down automatically. But this means you write programs in a different style. For example:\n\n- You can't `pip install` packages - you have to use `requirements.txt`\n- You can't read or write files from the file system - you can only use APIs.\n- You can't run commands (e.g. `subprocess.run()`)\n\n[Vercel](https://vercel.com/) is a cloud platform optimized for frontend frameworks and serverless functions. Vercel is tightly integrated with GitHub. Pushing to your repository automatically triggers new deployments.\n\nHere's a [quickstart](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtimes/python). [Sign-up with Vercel](https://vercel.com/signup). Create an empty `git` repo with this `api/index.py` file.\n\nTo deploy a FastAPI app, add a `requirements.txt` file with `fastapi` as a dependency.\n\n```text\nfastapi\n```\n\nAdd your FastAPI code to a file, e.g. `main.py`.\n\n```python\n# main.py\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\n\napp = FastAPI()\n\n@app.get(\"/\")\ndef read_root():\n    return {\"message\": \"Hello, World!\"}\n```\n\nAdd a `vercel.json` file to the root of your repository.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"builds\": [{ \"src\": \"main.py\", \"use\": \"@vercel/python\" }],\n  \"routes\": [{ \"src\": \"/(.*)\", \"dest\": \"main.py\" }]\n}\n```\n\nOn the command line, run:\n\n- `npx vercel` to deploy a test version\n- `npx vercel --prod` to deploy to production\n\n**Environment Variables**. Use `npx vercel env add` to add environment variables. In your code, use `os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')` to access them.\n\n### Videos\n\n[![Vercel Product Walkthrough](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/sPmat30SE4k/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/sPmat30SE4k)\n\n[![Deploy FastAPI on Vercel | Quick and Easy Tutorial](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/8R-cetf_sZ4/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/8R-cetf_sZ4)\n"

They use standard HTTP methods and JSON for data exchange.\n\nWatch this comprehensive introduction to REST APIs (52 min):\n\n[![REST API Crash Course - Introduction + Full Python API Tutorial (52)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/qbLc5a9jdXo/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/qbLc5a9jdXo)\n\nKey Concepts:\n\n1. **HTTP Methods**\n   - `GET`: Retrieve data\n   - `POST`: Create new data\n   - `PUT/PATCH`: Update existing data\n   - `DELETE`: Remove data\n2. **Status Codes**\n   - `2xx`: Success (200 OK, 201 Created)\n   - `4xx`: Client errors (400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found)\n   - `5xx`: Server errors (500 Internal Server Error)\n\nHere's a minimal REST API using FastAPI. Run this `server.py` script via `uv run server.py`:\n\n```python\n# /// script\n# requires-python = \">=3.13\"\n# dependencies = [\n#     \"fastapi\",\n#     \"uvicorn\",\n# ]\n# ///\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException\nfrom typing import Dict, List\n\napp = FastAPI()\n\n# Create a list of items that will act like a database\nitems: List[Dict[str, float | int | str]] = []\n\n# Create a GET endpoint that returns all items\n@app.get(\"/items\")\nasync def get_items() -> List[Dict[str, float | int | str]]:\n    return items\n\n# Create a GET endpoint that returns a specific item by ID\n@app.get(\"/items/{item_id}\")\nasync def get_item(item_id: int) -> Dict[str, float | int | str]:\n    if item := next((i for i in items if i[\"id\"] == item_id), None):\n        return item\n    raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail=\"Item not found\")\n\n# Create a POST endpoint that creates a new item\n@app.post(\"/items\")\nasync def create_item(item: Dict[str, float | str]) -> Dict[str, float | int | str]:\n    new_item = {\"id\": len(items) + 1, \"name\": item[\"name\"], \"price\": float(item[\"price\"])}\n    items.append(new_item)\n    return new_item\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    import uvicorn\n    uvicorn.run(app, host=\"0.0.0.0\", port=8000)\n```\n\nTest the API with curl:\n\n```bash\n# Get all items\ncurl http://localhost:8000/items\n\n# Create an item\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:8000/items \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"name\": \"Book\", \"price\": 29.99}'\n\n# Get specific item\ncurl http://localhost:8000/items/1\n```\n\nBest Practices:\n\n1. **Use Nouns for Resources**\n   - Good: `/users`, `/posts`\n   - Bad: `/getUsers`, `/createPost`\n2. **Version Your API**\n   ```\n   /api/v1/users\n   /api/v2/users\n   ```\n3. **Handle Errors Consistently**\n   ```python\n   {\n     \"error\": \"Not Found\",\n     \"message\": \"User 123 not found\",\n     \"status_code\": 404\n   }\n   ```\n4. **Use Query Parameters for Filtering**\n   ```\n   /api/posts?status=published&category=tech\n   ```\n5. **Implement Pagination**\n   ```\n   /api/posts?page=2&limit=10\n   ```\n\nTools:\n\n- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/): API testing and documentation\n- [Swagger/OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/): API documentation\n- [HTTPie](https://httpie.io/): Modern command-line HTTP client\n- [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/): API request/response validation\n\nLearn more about REST APIs:\n\n- [REST API Design Best Practices](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/03/02/best-practices-for-rest-api-design/)\n- [Microsoft REST API Guidelines](https://github.com/microsoft/api-guidelines)\n- [Google API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design)\n"

This impacts image size a lot\n- **Lossless** compression (PNG, WebP) preserves exact data\n- **Lossy** compression (JPEG, WebP) removes some data for smaller files\n- **Vector** formats (SVG) scale without quality loss\n- **WebP** is the modern standard, supporting both lossy and lossless\n\nHere's a rule of thumb you can use as of 2025.\n\n- Use SVG if you can (i.e. if it's vector graphics or you can convert it to one)\n- Else, reduce the image to as small as you can, and save as (lossy or lossless) WebP\n\nCommon operations with Python:\n\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport io\n\nasync def compress_image(input_path: Path, output_path: Path, quality: int = 85) -> None:\n    \"\"\"Compress an image while maintaining reasonable quality.\"\"\"\n    with Image.open(input_path) as img:\n        # Convert RGBA to RGB if needed\n        if img.mode == 'RGBA':\n            img = img.convert('RGB')\n        # Optimize for web\n        img.save(output_path, 'WEBP', quality=quality, optimize=True)\n\n# Batch process images\npaths = Path('images').glob('*.jpg')\nfor p in paths:\n    await compress_image(p, p.with_suffix('.webp'))\n```\n\nCommand line tools include [cwebp](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/cwebp), [pngquant](https://pngquant.org/), [jpegoptim](https://github.com/tjko/jpegoptim), and [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/).\n\n```bash\n# Convert to WebP\ncwebp -q 85 input.png -o output.webp\n\n# Optimize PNG\npngquant --quality=65-80 image.png\n\n# Optimize JPEG\njpegoptim --strip-all --all-progressive --max=85 image.jpg\n\n# Convert and resize\nconvert input.jpg -resize 800x600 output.jpg\n\n# Batch convert\nmogrify -format webp -quality 85 *.jpg\n```\n\nWatch this video on modern image formats and optimization (15 min):\n\n[![Modern Image Optimization (15 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/F1kYBnY6mwg/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/F1kYBnY6mwg)\n\nTools for image optimization:\n\n- [squoosh.app](https://squoosh.app/): Browser-based compression\n- [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/): GUI tool for Mac\n- [sharp](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/): Node.js image processing\n- [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/): Python imaging library\n"

    "content": "## Containers: Docker, Podman\n\n[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Podman](https://podman.io/) are containerization tools that package your application and its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development and deployment.\n\nDocker is the industry standard. Podman is compatible with Docker and has better security (and a slightly more open license). In this course, we recommend Podman but Docker works in the same way.\n\nInitialize the container engine:\n\n```bash\npodman machine init\npodman machine start\n```\n\nCommon Operations. (You can use `docker` instead of `podman` in the same way.)\n\n```bash\n# Pull an image\npodman pull python:3.11-slim\n\n# Run a container\npodman run -it python:3.11-slim\n\n# List containers\npodman ps -a\n\n# Stop container\npodman stop container_id\n\n# Scan image for vulnerabilities\npodman scan myapp:latest\n\n# Remove container\npodman rm container_id\n\n# Remove all stopped containers\npodman container prune\n```\n\nYou can create a `Dockerfile` to build a container image. Here's a sample `Dockerfile` that converts a Python script into a container image.\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM python:3.11-slim\n# Set working directory\nWORKDIR /app\n# Typically, you would use `COPY . .` to copy files from the host machine,\n# but here we're just using a simple script.\nRUN echo 'print(\"Hello, world!\")' > app.py\n# Run the script\nCMD [\"python\", \"app.py\"]\n```\n\nTo build, run, and deploy the container, run these commands:\n\n```bash\n# Create an account on https://hub.docker.com/ and then login\npodman login docker.io\n\n# Build and run the container\npodman build -t py-hello .\npodman run -it py-hello\n\n# Push the container to Docker Hub. Replace $DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME with your Docker Hub username.\npodman push py-hello:latest docker.io/$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/py-hello\n\n# Push adding a specific tag, e.g. dev\nTAG=dev podman push py-hello docker.io/$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/py-hello:$TAG\n```\n\nTools:\n\n- [Dive](https://github.com/wagoodman/dive): Explore image layers\n- [Skopeo](https://github.com/containers/skopeo): Work with container images\n- [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy): Security scanner\n\n[![Podman Tutorial Zero to Hero | Full 1 Hour Course](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/YXfA5O5Mr18/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/YXfA5O5Mr18)\n\n[![Learn Docker in 7 Easy Steps - Full Beginner's Tutorial](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/gAkwW2tuIqE/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/gAkwW2tuIqE)\n\n- Optional: For Windows, see [WSL 2 with Docker getting started](https://youtu.be/5RQbdMn04Oc)\n"

(Don't exceed that.)\n\nRead the [AI Pipe documentation](https://github.com/sanand0/aipipe) to learn how to use it. But in short:\n\n1. Replace `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, i.e. `https://api.openai.com/v1` with `https://aipipe.org/openrouter/v1...` or `https://aipipe.org/openai/v1...`\n2. Replace `OPENAI_API_KEY` with the [`AIPIPE_TOKEN`](https://aipipe.org/login)\n3. Replace model names, e.g. `gpt-4.1-nano`, with `openai/gpt-4.1-nano`\n\nFor example, let's use [Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/gemini/2-0-flash-lite) via [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001) for chat completions and [Text Embedding 3 Small](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/text-embedding-3-small) via [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/) for embeddings:\n\n```bash\ncurl https://aipipe.org/openrouter/v1/chat/completions \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $AIPIPE_TOKEN\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"model\": \"google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001\",\n    \"messages\": [{ \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What is 2 + 2?\"} }]\n  }'\n\ncurl https://aipipe.org/openai/v1/embeddings \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $AIPIPE_TOKEN\" \\\n  -d '{ \"model\": \"text-embedding-3-small\", \"input\": \"What is 2 + 2?\" }'\n```\n\nOr using [`llm`](https://llm.datasette.io/):\n\n```bash\nllm keys set openai --value $AIPIPE_TOKEN\n\nexport OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://aipipe.org/openrouter/v1\nllm 'What is 2 + 2?' -m openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001\n\nexport OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://aipipe.org/openai/v1\nllm embed -c 'What is 2 + 2' -m 3-small\n```\n\n**For a 50% discount** (but slower speed), use [Flex processing](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/flex-processing) by adding `service_tier: \"flex\"` to your JSON request.\n\n## AI Proxy - Jan 2025\n\nFor the Jan 2025 batch, we had created API keys for everyone with an `iitm.ac.in` email to use `gpt-4o-mini` and `text-embedding-3-small`.

    "content": "## Prompt Engineering\n\nPrompt engineering is the process of crafting effective prompts for large language models (LLMs).\n\nOne of the best ways to approach prompt engineering is to think of LLMs as a smart colleague (with amnesia) who needs explicit instructions.\n\nThe most authoritative guides are from the LLM providers themselves:\n\n- [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/)\n- [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/introduction-prompt-design)\n- [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering)\n\nHere are some best practices:\n\n### Use prompt optimizers\n\nThey rewrite your prompt to improve it. Explore:\n\n- [Anthropic Prompt Optimizer](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompt-improver)\n- [OpenAI Prompt Generation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-generation)\n- [Google AI-powered prompt writing tools](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/ai-powered-prompt-writing)\n\n### Be clear, direct, and detailed\n\nBe explicit and thorough. Include all necessary context, goals, and details so the model understands the full picture.\n\n- **BAD**: _Explain gravitation lensing._ (Reason: Vague and lacks context or detail.)\n- **GOOD**: _Explain the concept of gravitational lensing to a high school student who understands basic physics, including how it’s observed and its significance in astronomy._ (Reason: Specifies the audience, scope, and focus.)\n\n> When you ask a question, don’t be vague. Spell it out. Give every detail the listener needs.\n> The clearer you are, the better the answer you’ll get.\n> For example, don't just say, Explain Gravitation Lensing.\n> Say, Explain the concept of gravitational lensing to a high school student who understands basic physics, including how it’s observed and its significance in astronomy.\n\n[Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/be-clear-and-direct)\n| [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering#tactic-include-details-in-your-query-to-get-more-relevant-answers)\n| [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/clear-instructions)\n\n### Give examples\n\nProvide 2-3 relevant examples to guide the model on the style, structure, or format you expect. This helps the model produce outputs consistent with your desired style.\n\n- **BAD**: _Explain how to tie a bow tie._ (Reason: No examples or reference points given.)\n- **GOOD**:\n  _Explain how to tie a bow tie. For example:_\n\n  1. _To tie a shoelace, you cross the laces and pull them tight..._\n  2. _To tie a necktie, you place it around the collar and loop it through..._\n\n  _Now, apply a similar step-by-step style to describe how to tie a bow tie._ (Reason: Provides clear examples and a pattern to follow.)\n\n> Give examples to the model. If you want someone to build a house, show them a sketch. Don’t just say ‘build something.’\n> Giving examples is like showing a pattern. It makes everything easier to follow.\n\n[Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/multishot-prompting)\n| [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering#tactic-provide-examples)\n| [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/few-shot-examples)\n\n### Think step by step\n\nInstruct the model to reason through the problem step by step. This leads to more logical, well-structured answers.\n\n- **BAD**: _Given this transcript, is the customer satisfied?_ (Reason: No prompt for structured reasoning.)\n- **GOOD**: _Given this transcript, is the customer satisfied? Think step by step._ (Reason: Directly instructs the model to break down reasoning into steps.)\n\n> Ask the model to think step by step. Don’t ask the model to just give the final answer right away.\n> That's like asking someone to answer with the first thing that pops into their head.\n> Instead, ask them to break down their thought process into simple moves — like showing each rung of a ladder as they climb.\n> For example, when thinking step by step, the model could, A, list each customer question, B, find out if it was addressed, and C, decide that the agent answered only 2 out of the 3 questions.\n\n[Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/chain-of-thought)\n| [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering#strategy-give-models-time-to-think)\n| [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/break-down-prompts)\n\n### Assign a role\n\nSpecify a role or persona for the model. This provides context and helps tailor the response style.\n\n- **BAD**: _Explain how to fix a software bug._ (Reason: No role or perspective given.)\n- **GOOD**: _You are a seasoned software engineer. Explain how to fix a software bug in legacy code, including the debugging and testing process._ (Reason: Assigns a clear, knowledgeable persona, guiding the style and depth.)\n\n> Tell the model who they are. Maybe they’re a seasoned software engineer fixing a legacy bug, or an experienced copy editor revising a publication.\n> By clearly telling the model who they are, you help them speak with just the right expertise and style.\n> Suddenly, your explanation sounds like it’s coming from a true specialist, not a random voice.\n\n[Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/system-prompts)\n| [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering#tactic-ask-the-model-to-adopt-a-persona)\n| [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/assign-role)\n\n### Use XML to structure your prompt\n\nUse XML tags to separate different parts of the prompt clearly. This helps the model understand structure and requirements.\n\n- **BAD**: _Here’s what I want: Provide a summary and then an example._ (Reason: Unstructured, no clear separation of tasks.)\n- **GOOD**:\n  ```xml\n  <instructions>\n    Provide a summary of the concept of machine learning.\n  </instructions>\n  <example>\n    Then provide a simple, concrete example of a machine learning application (e.g., an email spam filter).\n  </example>\n  ```\n  (Reason: Uses XML tags to clearly distinguish instructions from examples.)\n\n> Think of your request like a box. XML tags are neat little labels on that box.\n> They help keep parts sorted, so nothing gets lost in the shuffle.\n\n[Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/use-xml-tags)\n| [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering#tactic-use-delimiters-to-clearly-indicate-distinct-parts-of-the-input)\n| [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/structure-prompts)\n\n### Use Markdown to format your output\n\nEncourage the model to use Markdown for headings, lists, code blocks, and other formatting features to produce structured, easily readable answers.\n\n- **BAD**: _Give me the steps in plain text._ (Reason: No specific formatting instructions, less readable.)\n- **GOOD**: _Provide the steps in a markdown-formatted list with ### headings for each section and numbered bullet points._ (Reason: Directly instructs to use Markdown formatting, making output more structured and clear.)\n- **BAD**: _Correct the spelling and show the corrections._ (Reason: No specific formatting instructions)\n- **GOOD**: _Correct the spelling, showing &lt;ins&gt;additions&lt;/ins&gt; and &lt;del&gt;deletions&lt;/del&gt;._ (Reason: Directly instructs to use HTML formatting, making output more structured and clear.)\n\n> Markdown is a simple formatting language that all models understand.\n> You can have them add neat headings, sections, bold highlights, and bullet points.\n> These make complex documents more scannable and easy on the eyes.\n\n### Use JSON for machine-readable output\n\nWhen you need structured data, ask for a JSON-formatted response. This ensures the output is machine-readable and organized.\n\n- **BAD**: _Just list the items._ (Reason: Unstructured plain text makes parsing harder.)\n- **GOOD**:\n\n  ````markdown\n  Organize as an array of objects in a JSON format, like this:\n\n  ```json\n  [\n    { \"name\": \"Item 1\", \"description\": \"Description of Item 1\" },\n    { \"name\": \"Item 2\", \"description\": \"Description of Item 2\" },\n    { \"name\": \"Item 3\", \"description\": \"Description of Item 3\" }\n  ]\n  ```\n  ````\n\n  (Reason: Instructing JSON format ensures structured, machine-readable output.)\n\nNote: Always use [JSON schema](playground#attachments) if possible. [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/) is a way to describe the structure of JSON data. An easy way to get the JSON schema is to give ChatGPT sample output and ask it to generate the schema.\n\n> Imagine you’re organizing data for a big project. Plain text is like dumping everything into one messy pile — it’s hard to find what you need later.\n> JSON, on the other hand, is like packing your data into neat, labeled boxes within boxes.\n> Everything has its place: fields like ‘name,’ ‘description,’ and ‘value’ make the data easy to read, especially for machines.\n> For example, instead of just listing items, you can structure them as a JSON array, with each item as an object.\n> That way, when you hand it to a program, it’s all clear and ready to use.\n\n### Prefer Yes/No answers\n\nConvert rating or percentage questions into Yes/No queries. LLMs handle binary choices better than numeric scales.\n\n- **BAD**: _On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you that this method works?_ (Reason: Asks for a numeric rating, which can be imprecise.)\n- **GOOD**: _Is this method likely to work as intended? Please give a reasoning and then answer Yes or No._ (Reason: A binary question simplifies the response and clarifies what’s being asked.)\n\n> Don’t ask ‘On a scale of one to five...’. Models are not good with numbers.\n> They don't know how to grade something 7 versus 8 on a 10 point scale. ‘Yes or no?’ is simple. It’s clear. It’s quick.\n> So, break your question into simple parts that they can answer with just a yes or a no.\n\n### Ask for reason first, then the answer\n\nInstruct the model to provide its reasoning steps _before_ stating the final answer. This makes it less likely to justify itself and more likely to think deeper, leading to more accurate results.\n\n- **BAD**: _What is the best route to take?_ (Reason: Direct question without prompting reasoning steps first.)\n- **GOOD**: _First, explain your reasoning step by step for how you determine the best route. Then, after you’ve reasoned it out, state your final recommendation for the best route._ (Reason: Forces the model to show its reasoning process before giving the final answer.)\n\n> BEFORE making its final choice, have the model talk through their thinking. Reasoning first, answer second.\n> That way, the model won't be tempted to justify an answer that they gave impulsively. It is also more likely to think deeper.\n\n### Use proper spelling and grammar\n\nA well-written, grammatically correct prompt clarifies expectations. Poorly structured prompts can confuse the model.\n\n- **BAD**: _xplin wht the weirless netork do? make shur to giv me a anser??_ (Reason: Poor spelling and unclear instructions.)\n- **GOOD**: _Explain what a wireless network does. Please provide a detailed, step-by-step explanation._ (Reason: Proper spelling and clarity lead to a more coherent response.)\n\n> If your question sounds like gibberish, expect a messy answer. Speak cleanly.\n> When you do, the response will be much clearer.\n\n## Video Tutorials\n\nWatch [Prompt Engineering Tutorial – Master ChatGPT and LLM Responses (41 min)](https://youtu.be/_ZvnD73m40o).

Users can log in with their existing Google accounts.\n- It's secure: Google supports OAuth2 and OpenID Connect to handle authentication.\n\nHere's how you build a FastAPI app that identifies the user.\n\n1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console – Credentials](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials) and click **Create Credentials > OAuth client ID**.\n2. Choose **Web application**, set your authorized redirect URIs (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/`).\n3.

    "content": "## CORS: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing\n\nCORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security mechanism that controls how web browsers handle requests between different origins (domains, protocols, or ports). Data scientists need CORS for APIs serving data or analysis to a browser on a different domain.\n\nWatch this practical explanation of CORS (3 min):\n\n[![CORS in 100 Seconds](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/4KHiSt0oLJ0/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/4KHiSt0oLJ0)\n\nKey CORS concepts:\n\n- **Same-Origin Policy**: Browsers block requests between different origins by default\n- **CORS Headers**: Server responses must include specific headers to allow cross-origin requests\n- **Preflight Requests**: Browsers send OPTIONS requests to check if the actual request is allowed\n- **Credentials**: Special handling required for requests with cookies or authentication\n\nIf you're exposing your API with a GET request publicly, the only thing you need to do is set the HTTP header `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`.\n\nHere are other common CORS headers:\n\n```http\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: https://example.com\nAccess-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE\nAccess-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization\nAccess-Control-Allow-Credentials: true\n```\n\nTo implement CORS in FastAPI, use the [`CORSMiddleware` middleware](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/cors/):\n\n```python\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\nfrom fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware\n\napp = FastAPI()\n\napp.add_middleware(CORSMiddleware, allow_origins=[\"*\"]) # Allow GET requests from all origins\n# Or, provide more granular control:\napp.add_middleware(\n    CORSMiddleware,\n    allow_origins=[\"https://example.com\"],  # Allow a specific domain\n    allow_credentials=True,  # Allow cookies\n    allow_methods=[\"GET\", \"POST\", \"PUT\", \"DELETE\"],  # Allow specific methods\n    allow_headers=[\"*\"],  # Allow all headers\n)\n```\n\nTesting CORS with JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\n// Simple request\nconst response = await fetch(\"https://api.example.com/data\", {\n  method: \"GET\",\n  headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" },\n});\n\n// Request with credentials\nconst response = await fetch(\"https://api.example.com/data\", {\n  credentials: \"include\",\n  headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" },\n});\n```\n\nUseful CORS debugging tools:\n\n- [CORS Checker](https://cors-test.codehappy.dev/): Test CORS configurations\n- Browser DevTools Network tab: Inspect CORS headers and preflight requests\n- [cors-anywhere](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere): CORS proxy for development\n\nCommon CORS errors and solutions:\n\n- `No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header`: Configure server to send proper CORS headers\n- `Request header field not allowed`: Add required headers to `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`\n- `Credentials flag`: Set both `credentials: 'include'` and `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`\n- `Wild card error`: Cannot use `*` with credentials; specify exact origins\n"

It runs cells reactively - when you change one cell, all dependent cells update automatically, just like a spreadsheet.\n\nMarimo's cells can't be run out of order. This makes Marimo more reproducible and easier to debug, but requires a mental shift from the Jupyter/Colab way of working.\n\nIt also runs Python directly in the browser and is quite interactive. [Browse the gallery of examples](https://marimo.io/gallery). With a wide variety of interactive widgets, It's growing popular as an alternative to Streamlit for building data science web apps.\n\nCommon Operations:\n\n```python\n# Create new notebook\nuvx marimo new\n\n# Run notebook server\nuvx marimo edit notebook.py\n\n# Export to HTML\nuvx marimo export notebook.py\n```\n\nBest Practices:\n\n1. **Cell Dependencies**\n   - Keep cells focused and atomic\n   - Use clear variable names\n   - Document data flow between cells\n2. **Interactive Elements**\n\n   ```python\n   # Add interactive widgets\n   slider = mo.ui.slider(1, 100)\n   # Create dynamic Markdown\n   mo.md(f\"{slider} {\"🟢\" * slider.value}\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Version Control**\n   - Keep notebooks are Python files\n   - Use Git to track changes\n   - Publish on [marimo.app](https://marimo.app/) for collaboration\n\n[![\"marimo: an open-source reactive notebook for Python\" - Akshay Agrawal (Nbpy2024)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/9R2cQygaoxQ/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/9R2cQygaoxQ)\n"

Because someone else might have another minor issue they want to fix. We have to apply the rule uniformly.\nUnfortunately we cannot allow submissions that fail the prerequisites.\nChanging it now will not suddenly make it eligible.\nThese things do matter when done at scale.  Its an important lesson Anand wants students to understand. These “minor” things matter.\nIts a bit like assembling a rocket and forgetting the checklist for the pilot. Minor detail, costs Rs 2, but the rocket cannot leave without it.\nWe had a significant discussion about it internally. For the sake of fairness to everyone who got it right, we cannot allow edits after the Project deadline. It makes the prerequisites meaningless, especially when it was clearly stressed upon in the sessions and the Project page.\nI know you will feel very disappointed but it is the decision the team has made and I have shared the reasons why.\nKindest regards",

The whole point is for it to run not just on your system. It should be deployable anywhere on any machine. Your solution should work anywhere we test it. Thats why you package it in a docker container. How you achieve that is up to you. But if we cannot run your docker container according to the specification we have provided then it has failed this crucial test.\nKind regards",

I am writing to highlight several issues and doubts related to different aspects of the course that require clarification and resolution.\n1. Graded Assignments (GA)\n\n\nGA6 Doubts Unresolved: While doubts related to Q1 and Q2 have been addressed, other queries remain unresolved despite being posted in the GA6 thread . The deadline has passed, but no solutions have been provided. (Thread link)\n\n\nGA Platform Changes: Initially, we were solving questions on exam.sanand.workers.dev . However, in GA6, we moved to Seek and in GA7, to Google Forms. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments.\n\n\n2. Project Updates\n\nProject 1: The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful.\nProject 2: There are multiple doubts posted in the Project 2 discussion thread, but they have not been addressed yet. Without these clarifications, it is difficult to proceed with the project. Could you please provide an expected timeline for when these queries will be resolved?  (thread link)\n\n3. ROE Score Update\n\nWhile ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected.\n\nI appreciate your time and assistance in addressing these concerns. Looking forward to your response.\nBest regards,\nLakshay",

    "content": "lakshaygarg654:\n\nGA Platform Changes: Initially, we were solving questions on exam.sanand.workers.dev . However, in GA6, we moved to Seek and in GA7, to Google Forms. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments.\n\n\nThe course is in transition. Initially all of it used to be on seek portal. But there were limitations of seek portal that we were not able to work around to deliver the kind of interactive, reactive and rapid corrections/iterations that are now possible because we moved the evaluations from the seek portal to the TDS server. Since the move to the new TDS server on the back end, we are able to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever doubts are raised. This is NOT possible on seek portal for us. The results are immediate to see. You got timely rapid feedback for GA 1 to GA 5 from the TAs. The TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors and the professor as well as operations.\nWith GA 6 our inability to actually see your individual question sets immediately (its possible, but it has to take a very circuitous route via 3 set of people) meant we were always on the back foot for both, checking the answers, as well as making any corrections. And since the questions were parameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely cumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive to all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning. We have seen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek portal. This is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that directly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like TDS.\nGA 7 was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above. GA6 was straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation. Whereas GA7 is once again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in Seek Portal. Since it was not possible in such a short time to transition GA7 to our preferred hosting server and student favourite, we opted for the least disruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon.\n\n\n\n lakshaygarg654:\n\nProject 1: The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful.\n\n\nProject 1 evaluations is VERY computationally intensive for us to evaluate. Each project although dockerised, with an average submission weighing at 2GB, we have to provision space of 1 TB along with the cloud computer resources for all of that (RAM and vCPUs) and if you thought creating project 1 was tough, you can imagine the technical challenge involved in evaluating the 600+ submissions with all the errors and issues we have to fix. In truth its all hands on deck for us here on the back end because it has been deemed critical. So while we are moving the course along, we are also aware that evaluations are at serious risk of missing crucial deadlines. We are taking the matter with utmost seriousness. Its just that we cant always keep you up to date on every set back we are facing.\nEach and everyone of us are concerned about Project 1 and are working on it. Anand, JK, Prasanna, myself, Jivraj and Saransh. We all have been given access to the eval server which we only managed to provision a few days ago and we are all trying to get the most ambitious TDS project evaluation out the dry dock and into the water and hoping it floats gracefully rather than sink in the estuary. Meanwhile we are busy patching the pipes in the belly of the ship while its rolling down the slipway.\n\n\n\n lakshaygarg654:\n\n3. ROE Score Update\n\nWhile ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected.\n\n\n\nYou got the maximum possible mark in ROE. Does it not show you got 100 in ROE in the dashboard? I have been told by operations that it has been pushed.\nKind regards",

Regarding ROE, we initially assumed that marks would be awarded in the same manner as GA4 (110/100); however, now that you have clarified the maximum marks is 100.\nMeanwhile, we would like to know if a session can be arranged to discuss the solution for Project 1. This would be beneficial for us in working on Project 2.

    "content": "@23f2003413\nWe will have it uploaded sometime this morning.\nIt has two parts to it. The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real time (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things:\n\nThe chaos of ROE.\nThe adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools.\nThe limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this).\nThe value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team.\nThe ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly\nWorkflow of ROE: Data Extraction → Data Cleaning → Data Transformation → Data Analyisis → Information to answer questions\nThe pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well).\nHow limited the time is.\n\nThe second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students felt. The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE.\nPast terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us.\nToday’s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without a time limit).\nI would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise to the pressure cooker of ROE. You will make stupid mistakes under pressure. The TAs did yesterday as well. So best to reduce this factor by getting used to the clock.\nKind regards",

    "content": "Dear @jkmadathil @Anand @Bharathi\nFirst and foremost, we sincerely appreciate the efforts of the TDS team in supporting us throughout this course. The live sessions and guidance have been helpful, and we recognize the intent to make this a valuable learning experience.\nHowever, despite these efforts, many of us have faced significant challenges in keeping up with the course expectations.\nKey Challenges Faced\n Lack of Prerequisites\nThis course did not list any prerequisites, leading many students—including those from non-technical backgrounds—to enroll with the expectation that they could keep up. However, the reality is that the course content, assignments, and projects have been far more complex than anticipated, making it difficult to manage.\n Project Complexity & Deadline Pressure\nThe difficulty of the projects has been overwhelming, requiring most of us to rely heavily on peer support just to meet the deadlines. Despite putting in our best efforts, many of us struggled to complete them successfully.\n Course Structure Changes & Misleading Past Feedback\nMany students joined TDS based on past Discourse posts and feedback, which suggested a different course structure. With the recent changes, it has been a tough transition—especially for working professionals and students without prior experience.\n Remote Open Exam (RoE) & Graded Assignments (GAs)\nWhile we have put in significant effort—spending 2-3 days on Graded Assignments (GAs) to secure good scores—we still find ourselves struggling to meet expectations for the projects and RoE, which are significantly harder than anticipated.\nWe completely understand the need to maintain academic standards, but we also hope fairness is considered. Since many of us are putting in our best efforts but still finding it hard to meet the course demands, we kindly request a revision of the grading pattern. Increasing the weightage of Graded Assignments (GAs) would help ensure that the dedication and hard work of students are fairly reflected in their grades. This would allow students to pass with a reasonable grade while still maintaining the integrity of the course.\nWe truly respect the effort that has gone into designing this course, and we are all here because we genuinely want to learn and grow. We only ask that the grading structure consider the diverse backgrounds of students so that everyone has a fair chance to succeed.\nThank you for your time and understanding. We appreciate your consideration and hope to find a way forward that benefits both students and the course objectives.",

    "content": "Hi @s.anand @jkmadathil @Bharathi @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini\nCould you please look into the above issue?\nAdditionally, I’d like to highlight a concern regarding the current grading pattern ( JAN 2025 Term ) and overall course structuring:\nGrading Concerns\nFinal Course Score:\nT = 0.15GAA + 0.2 ROE1 + 0.2 P1 + 0.2 P2 + 0.25 F\n(The weightage of Projects + ROE accounts for 60% of the total score.)\nFrom the following Discourse post, it appears that the ROE exam is extremely difficult to the point of being considered “impossible” by students:\nWhat’s the actual purpose of impossible ROE exam?.\nGiven this, many students may directly lose 20 marks due to ROE, significantly impacting their overall scores.\nFurthermore, for Project 1 (deadline: 16th Feb 2025), guidance was provided only in the week of the deadline. This was highly inconvenient, as the live session did not effectively address all student concerns. As a result, many students are at risk of losing a valuable 20 marks for Project 1.\nCourse Structuring & Scheduling Issues\n\nMany students pursuing this course are dual-degree students or working professionals, making it challenging to keep up with live sessions and deadlines.\nThe last-minute guidance for projects adds unnecessary pressure, especially for those juggling work or other academic commitments.\nThe structuring and scheduling of sessions feel inappropriate, with crucial guidance sessions being held too late, making it difficult to implement feedback or clarify doubts in time.\n\nRequest for Improvement\nTo ensure a smoother learning experience, I request:\n\nEarly guidance and detailed instructions for Project 2, well in advance of the deadline.\nMore structured and accessible support, considering the diverse student base, including working professionals.\nBetter management of exam difficulty levels, ensuring that assessments are fair and reflect actual learning rather than being unnecessarily tough.\n\nI hope these concerns can be taken into account, and necessary improvements can be made. Looking forward to your response.",

    "content": "Thank you @A_LAKSHMI for the detailed post. This is much appreciated. Thought of quickly stepping in before Anand or other members from the course team gives a more detailed response.\nLet me be Open and Blunt to all in saying that the grading pattern will not be changed.  And the points below are some of quick things that came to my mind while reading the detailed listing of the challenges that have been put in the OP.\n\nTDS team have been tinkering with the course structure for the past 3 terms. You can check this Discourse thread where students have unanimously said that this is not an easy subject. In fact the first page of the TDS course GA1 itself should have given everyone an indication of what lies ahead. Anand has explicitly written down the below words:\n\n\nThis course is quite hard\nHere’s students’ feedback:\n\nIt used to be an easy course until 2024. # # #\nNow it’s hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible. # # #\nPlan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses. # # #\nLLMs grade you – unpredictably. # #\nThe ROE is hard. #\n\nTake Graded assignment 1 to check if you’re ready for this course. Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It’ll be too tough for you now.\n\n\nTDS (or for that matter any course in this Degree program) is not supposed to be a single person effort. You should be realizing this even in your real life. A significant part of our learning process is social by nature. The only difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate. If there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this - Surviving tough situations require support all around us, and there is no shame in asking for help\nAgain to quote Anand:\n\n\nWe encourage learning by sharing\nYou CAN copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam).\nWhy should you copy? Because in real life, there’s no time to re-invent the wheel. You’ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It’s important to learn how to do that well.\nTo learn well, understand what you’re copying. If you’re short of time, prioritize.\nTo learn better, teach what you’ve learnt.\n\n\nNow will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself).\nOnce again Anand has a nice blog where [I think] he is trying to explain that neither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit us. This is a journey that all of us are taking together, and we hope such open interactions along with the course will make the learning (or teaching) experience enjoyable  and internally make us more humble.\nWhether you like it or not, life is becoming more complex day by day. And unless you figure out your optimization strategy, it is going to be a bumpy ride. And this is true even for the TDS course team members. Each of us are also juggling multiple responsibilities (some even doing 4 projects in this term) while ensuring that needed support can be provided to the learners. This is not lighten the issues that any of you have highlighted here, but just to point out that there is no flowery path for anyone here.\nThen the major question will be, why are all of doing this crazy business of learning tools in this way. The simplest answer is - Tools are evolving day by day, and unless we realize that they are just “tools”, it is going to consume us an eternity to master them The point of all the exercises and assessments, is for you to understand the fundamental aspects related to a tool and figure out your own strategies for getting a grip on them.\n@22f2001640 Management of time and difficulty levels are a shared responsibility. All of you have been sufficiently warned that the learning process wont be easy. In fact we have released all major content well in advance, so that learners can benefit from early access. And from our side, we also have realized the supporting learners wouldn’t be easy. But I see that the TDS course team members have been putting their heart and soul in this course (and support), and even in this week they have prepared 3 sets of ROEs in order to ensure that all of you get enough practice opportunity.",

I want to invest myself in the ROE and the remaining project, but at this point I’m so frustrated about getting at least 40 that rather than a valuable learning experience, this course seems like a burden to me.\nI understand that the grading can’t be changed. All I hope and request that project 2 and end term turn out to be more approachable than project 1 and ROE so that after all this hard work, students like me at least get the privilege to pass.",

Thanks for the opportunity to share my thought process. \nWhat does this RoE evaluate? Implicit learning. \n\nImplicit learning is “How much can they answer if woken up from sleep?”\nExplicit learning is “How much can they answer given time and Internet?”\n\nSome may know 10% implicitly. Some know 50%. They’ll answer those in a few seconds. \nSome, they can FIND out. with Google, StackOverflow, ChatGPT. That’s explicit learning. But it takes time…",

    "content": "It is not mandatory to attempt mocks at 7pm. But we will solve it in real time during the session. Thats why we are releasing it 1 hour before. We will freeze the form submissions during the solving session and then reopen it later.\nROE is not like other exams you have done so far in this entire diploma.\nSolving it leisurely will give you a false sense of your capabilities.\nThe truth is everyone can get full marks for ROE given enough time.\nThe problem is the lack of time.\nSo if you want to really check ROE readiness, fix the timer alarm for 45 mins and attempt it genuinely within the 45 mins. Only then will you know where you stand.\nAdditionally, each ROE is completely different from the next. If you manage to do good in one is ZERO guarantee that you will do good in the next.\nThats why do all 4 mock ROEs. ROE is not like any other exam. Other exams have the same types of questions. Not with ROE.\nThe real ROE will be also something that no one has seen before.\nBut we will help you be as ready as possible for it.\nKind regards",

These are not set in stone and still is in the design/validation phase.\nWe generally avoid calling it week 3 content etc. because all the content was released as modules at the beginning well before the term was started.\nThe GAs are released as we complete validations on them. Each term the course assignments are updated to stay current with industry expectations. So they are not recycled like subjects that are static like maths, statistics and programming which have syllabi that have not changed in 10 years or more.\nWe try to release GAs so that they match the cadence of the other subjects for the convenience of students wherever possible. But rarely do other subjects require constant revalidation for their GAs.\nHence we have situations, even in past terms, where GAs and Projects get moved to allow for robust validations of the answers. In spite of this some errors do slip through due to the aggressive time schedule in a trimester system as opposed to a semester system.\nHope that give you some insight into how TDS works.\nThanks for bearing with us. TDS is perpetually a WIP.\nKind regards",

Collaboration with others is going be helpful. ROE is not proctored and is open internet. There is a reason for that. Its very hard.\nThere will be a dataset or multiple datasets. Sometimes you may have to combine datasets to answer questions. You will have to extract data from the dataset. You will have to transform/clean the data and you will have to gain some information from the data, is what typical ROEs test.\nKind regards",

After several attempts my submission still generated differences from the supposed answers. I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the error wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5 seconds.\nHere was my transcription - \" Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed.\nIn a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure’s voice emerged from the gloom, “You are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.”\nThe mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal—a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice.\nVictor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind.\nFrom within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund’s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations.\nMiranda’s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor’s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor’s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation \"",

So, the case was not passed. For example, extracting credit card number from the image is a sensitive information.\nI am alright with it since the evaluation will be different.\nNow, I am really well versed with the tools taught in these weeks.

Here are the highlights of the discussion:\n\nWe have moved Graded Assignment 5 (GA5) deadline which was due on 16th Feb to 21st Feb next Friday.\nAll the material to be able to do Project was available in Module 2 and Module 3, which was released on or before 10th of January (36 days ago)\nProject 1 was released 19th of January (27 days ago)\nWe had over 9 hours of sessions exclusively covering Project 1 (of which at least 8 hours are available on YouTube.) This excludes any week 2 and week 3 content which also would have given you the necessary skills to do Project 1. The sessions on YouTube give you a start to finish overview of how to approach it.\n\nAll of your concerns were duly noted and mentioned. Considering all the above, including the concerns mentioned by students:\nProject 1 deadline will NOT be changed.\nPlease make sure to carefully read the Deliverables and the Evaluation section and do them carefully and watch the intro to Week 3 - Session 1 to get an overview of what is absolutely essential and required. Watch Week 5 both sessions to see how we construct these requirements.\nKind regards\nTDS Team",

(Some have Gate exam on Saturday also). So, extending the timeline to at least Sunday, 16th Feb would be truly appreciated.\n\n\nWeek 3 release date timeline is 24 Jan, we need adequate time to go through the weekly materials. All the contents are already released, so by the same logic upcoming Project 2 contents are also available but that doesn’t mean that we can complete the upcoming project within a week.\n\n\nProject help sessions came on 11th February(live) and 12th Feb on YouTube, just 4 days before the submission date, though I am not complaining about this and genuinely appreciating the team’s effort, but this does gives very less time for many of us here.\n\n\nThank you.",

    "content": "Hi Vikram,\nThis is because (if you watched the session, or examined the code, you would have realised that) datagen.py was designed to run inside your docker container. And datagen.py (or a similar named file which we will not tell you ahead of time and will be provided as the query parameter in task A1) will normally be called by evaluate.py\nInside the docker container, permission for the data folder is set by the Dockerfile\nwhich then allows your application to access the root folder inside your docker image and create the /data folder.\nSo the workflow is like this (for your internal testing only… please follow the Project page for deliverables and evaluation to submit project successfully):\n\nYou create your application server that serves 2 endpoints on localhost:8000\nYou create a docker image that runs this application server.\nYou run the docker image using podman as described in the project page.\nFor mimicking the testing conditions. You need two files:\nevaluate.py and datagen.py to be in the same folder where you are running these two scripts.\nRun evalute.py using uv.\n\nIf your docker image is correctly configured and your application is correctly configured, then all the tasks run by evaluate.py will correctly tell you if the application is producing the right result for each task.\nHope that gives clarity.\nKind regards",

    "content": "Hi Hari,\nThe goal of the course was never to go deep into specific technologies, with perhaps the exception of LLMs as major tooling capability for data science. Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students. The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended.\nHave you watched this session in particular?\n\n\n\n\nIf thats insufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just introducing it\n\n\n\n\nfollowed by another 2 hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use cases\n\n\n\n\nBut of course does everyone want to watch 5.5 hours of sessions to understand it? That depends on the student.\nUltimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them because only then can we address gaps in understanding.\nKind regards",

    "content": "Is it considered best practice to create a virtual environment rather than installing packages globally, especially when working on projects that require multiple libraries? I understand that in a professional setting, we often work on multiple projects simultaneously, and developing the habit of using virtual environments now can help reinforce this practice for future projects.\nAdditionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation. However, I have encountered instances where a specific version failed to install, requiring me to modify the requirements.txt file and remove the version constraint. In such cases, wouldn’t installing directly via pip be more practical?\nThat said, I also recognize that different projects may have unique dependency requirements. I’d appreciate your insights on best practices for managing dependencies efficiently.",

    "content": "Yes, using a virtual environment is definitely considered best practice when working on Python projects. This approach helps avoid dependency conflicts between projects and ensures a consistent development environment. The main reasons why you should use virtual environments:\n\n\nIsolation – Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects.\n\n\nReproducibility – A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies.\n\n\nPortability – You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering.\n\n\n\n\nInstalling with pip individually (pip install package-name)\n\n• Good for quick experimentation and testing.\n• Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time.\n\nUsing requirements.txt\n\n• Best for reproducibility and collaboration since others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.\n• Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks compatibility with another developer’s setup.\nSpecifying Versions in requirements.txt\n• If you don’t specify a version, pip install -r requirements.txt will install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected breaking changes.\n• If you do specify a version (package==1.2.3), you ensure consistency but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has compatibility issues.\nHandling Version Conflicts\n• If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version constraint and reinstall.\n• Instead of completely omitting version numbers, consider:\n• Using greater than/less than constraints: package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes).\n• Running pip freeze > requirements.txt after confirming a stable environment.\nBest Practices Summary\n\nAlways use a virtual environment (e.g., venv or conda).\nUse a requirements.txt file for reproducibility.\nPin versions cautiously—avoid unnecessary strict versioning unless needed.\nPeriodically review and update dependencies to prevent using outdated or insecure packages.\n\nKind regards",

    "content": "For some projects where there are many dependencies, like an ML project or flask app, it’s better you mantain a virtual environment since the dependencies are interconnected with their versions.\nWhereas for some simple projects, with less dependencies, global installation is fine.\n\nFor project that is to be deployed, make sure you use the virtual environment, only then you can ensure what worked for you also works on the deployement\n\n\n\n\n\n 24f2006531:\n\nAdditionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file?\n\n\nComing to your second question,\nThe first time you install a fresh dependency, use direct and latest version. But if you are cloning or thinking of sharing the repo or using someone’s project it’s better to use requirements.txt.\n\n\n\n\n 24f2006531:\n\nMy understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation\n\n\nThe creation of requirements.txt ensures that the current installation version is listed.\n\nNever try to list requirements.txt. There is a command to do that, pip3 freeze > requirements.txt . This does the hard work of listing the dependencies for you",

That means indirectly, one should complete many courses diploma in programming before doing TDS.\nIn such a case, how to drop the course Tools In Data Science(already registered) and get it replaced with another course to save time and without incurring financial losses(as dropping a course refunds only a certain percentage of fees amount paid for the course), and do it again later in terms. It’s completely IIT Madras’s fault since it was mentioned in the academics site that no prerequisites were required for the course while the reality turned out to be far from promises. I want to either get the course structure for the TDS revised or get it replaced with some another course; incase of some course fee difference, I will pay the difference amount.",

While I understand the necessity of these tutorials, they lack immediate exercises, which makes it difficult to retain the knowledge gained. Attempting to practice everything from these tutorials leaves insufficient time for other courses.\nAdditionally, while solving GAs helps reinforce learning, they don’t seem to cover all the concepts from the tutorials.\nI would want to know whether the learning from GAs is sufficient or if there’s a better way to balance this.\nPS - To address this at a management level, my suggestion would be to introduce AQs  or  mini exercises after each module. Alternatively, we could increase questions in GAs to cover more concepts, though the first approach might be more effective. Another improvement could be to reduce the diversity of content in a single week to make it more manageable.",

    "content": "In ROE , usually you have to find the answers of the questions by solving them using codes and tools explained in the course .\nFor example you have a large pdf file of some patients and their disease and you are said to find number patients having some XYZ disease in that pdf . Now you can get this answer by using parsing tools and few lines of codes and after getting the results you can write that answer back in the portal .\nSame goes for assignments , they will be more like minor project works.",

We will ONLY evaluate the image id which was present at the time of the docker repo being pulled. This acts as a time stamped frozen version of your repo. No other image id will be evaluated.\nHow to fix bugs in our scripts\nCreate Pull requests to Jivraj-18/tds-jan25-project1 .\nDocker Image Architecture Issue Report\nIf your Docker image was run on the wrong architecture, please fill out this form:\nSubmit Report\nBug fixes\nIf you find bugs in our evaluation scripts, you might benefit from more marks because of the bug fix.

I’ve noticed that some students who completed GA7 are receiving bonus marks for extra peer reviews (5 bonus marks is quite significant as it improves grades as well). However, what about those of us who completed all 6 assignments but missed GA7 for some reason?\nAs the course is quite challenging due to the vast syllabus, bonus marks would be really helpful for many of us. Could you kindly clarify the situation?\nThank you and Regards\nAkshit",

This unexpected shift has raised concerns about transparency and fairness principles that should be central to academic assessment.

We respectfully urge the course coordinators to offer clarification and ensure that all students are evaluated on an equal footing.
